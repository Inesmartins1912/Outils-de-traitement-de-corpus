I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
And move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Trippin' over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needin' stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seein' red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm goin' under
But I know that I'll make it out alive

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?

Seems you cannot be replaced

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""

He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us

"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

Sensual politics

Hand under my sweatshirt

'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me

단 하루도 너를, 잊은 적이 없었지 난
솔직히, 보고 싶은데, 이만 너를 지울게
그게 널 원망하기보단 덜 아프니까
시린 널 불어내 본다
연기처럼, 하얀 연기처럼
말로는 지운다 해도

Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph

Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet

Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

"I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you

Crying 'cause you weren't around

Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh

Can't drive past the places we used to go to

I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing

You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing

'Fore I'd have to go be free?
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""

One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by

And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes

And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
Huh, hmm, hmm

During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, ""Mother never weep,"" my brother finds blood
I say, ""Shut up ’fore she sees,"" another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, ""Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters""
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models, this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (Someone hexed all the bottles)

But in my eyes, I can fly

You caught me on my knees
Don't pressure me for some kids
And I won't pressure you for marriage
I know it's never the right time
But we gotta do things on our time
Sometimes I still doubt myself
But at least now I love myself
And I am quite emotional
That's why you can't get close at all
So I start to push away
The ones that love me cause I'm scared that they might walk away
I'm not perfect
So I try everyday and I grow a little bit
Read a little more so I can educate my kids
Reap for my soul and cleanse my spirit

Pullin' my strings 'til the melody sings

Swallow your pride, I'll make you proud

What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter

Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, ooh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no
What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway

She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go

I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo

Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out

Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

I don't know why I got so attached

We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

"Poolside convo about your summer last night (Ooh, yeah)
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Sometimes, you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us
I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life
Is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her

Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)

Singin' to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, ""I only think of you""
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)

When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe

And I won't stop until I start to stand out, mm

Livin' all their lives waiting in the wings

And no means of escape
Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape
It ain't a question of ""how""

And you know I'm going all of the way to the end

All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance
To prove, I got whatever it takes

On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God

Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
I know you gon' be mad, feelings that you thought you had
Was for another guy, well, I'm that other guy
I'm just a shy kid, camouflaged before your eyes
And I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side
I should have told you, but I never had the courage
And I thought you really wouldn’t understand (No)
And now, I'm up here just to let my feelings surface
Apologizin' for disguisin' who I am (Mm)
Tell me, are you who I thought you were?
Or who I wanted you to be?
Did you do it all for him?
Or were you only playin' me?

But I got caught in the shadow in the background
But I'm back now
And Kris was all this and that
And my look didn't really fit the rap, it didn't match
He had the style and I had the swag
So I locked up my feelings in the words he said
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask
If you give me a chance, that's all I ask
What you expectin' me to do?
First, you were him and now you're you
Now, it's just me, and you got me on my knees

But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)

(Not blue flashing lights) If you've done nothing wrong

Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept

Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

Shadow shows no emotion, so what's even the fuss?

Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper
""Look, blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was runnin', I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""

You a bully or a lover?
Are you my man or my big brother?

You make it hard to wanna stay with ya

You my nigga, not my master, I'll escape

As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike

And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You captured this heart of mine
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life
You're my sunshine
A beautiful flower
Wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion
While I was lying in the autumn breeze
I felt a brush against my skin
So elegantly free
So delicate was she
And something deep within was calling out to me
Where have you been?
I've waited patiently
I never thought you'd find your way
Her voice so heavenly
Dear God
I can't believe
An angel sent to me
Don't ever go away
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life
You're my sunshine
A beautiful flower
Wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion
I picked a petal just to taste and see
Oh, how sweet your love could really be
Then all the honeybees would surely envy me
Don't let this fantasy become a memory
I'll be the rain that falls upon you
Let me be your morning dew
I'll be the breeze embracing you
I'll be the sun that shines so brightly
On the darker side of you
Throughout the night
I'll be your guiding light
The star that's watching you
Do you recall the time
You captured this heart of mine
Lying in a field full of dandelions
You are my life
You're my sunshine
A beautiful flower
Wild but yet divine
So hard to find
I'm glad I picked my lovely dandelion

Lovely is she
Heaven sent
Beauty far beyond what any eye can see
And now my life is so complete
And I believe you're the air I breathe

My everything

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl
I understand that there's some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryna stay busy 'til you heard from dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away
I understand that there are some problems and I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you, even though you might not show
If I can't apologize for being wrong, then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain and you can put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me (Oh, yeah)
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryna put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryna have fun
Her daddy should have never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen gettin' shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryna entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you
And you can put that blame on me (On me)
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me (Blame's on me)
And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me",rap,"Akon_Sorry,_Blame_It_On_Me.txt"
"Let's begin
Asalaam alaikum, people of good will
I offer you the greeting of thought-manifested skill
To finally reveal the open-end chapter
As real as the flesh that you're embodied in
To the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in
And there might have been a slight rotation warp to curve the course
Of course I'm cordial when I report, I won't distort
I don't contort, connect, conduct, collect, console, or conceal
In full control of the roll of the wheel
My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute destruction
Your structure is lifted from the ground
The foundation mound is broke, so you float around
I'm embedded in what is known as beat
Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete
In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump rapidly
Heart rate, happily marched
I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
But it ain't the same, though, yo
The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
Sliding through holes like small rodents
It's obviously evident my embellishment peaks at 292 IQ
'Cause Big Ace is the spinner in the center, inventor
And I plan to be a winner
Meaning I'll be in the inner-outer ovaries
Overload, overboard, overseas
Hearin' oversees more than the eye can
I stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist
The way I shape this landscape automatically makes this vivid
I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot
I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit
Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
And you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
You can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time
'Cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
Consider me part of the dust in the dusk
I must collect the samples from the rust
Penetrate the crust then trust no living
Driven by the sonic language passion
Your ashes spark the flashes of the neon from beyond
What kind of planet could I be on?
I don't know, but I'ma be on for eons and eons
While many think that they can never play out
Get trapped in a timeframe and never find a way out
I stay off the dramatization
And I balance, always seeking the challenge
To show the world the incredible talents
I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces
Worthlessness is just half of the problem
I read the grid, kid, I did every column
I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum, wild style 'em!
Until they get to hit the target, I mark it on the bullseye of flies
And the buffalo wing in the sky
My architech-nique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground
I suggest that you warn your town
I inhabit the oxygen mark off the memory
You will never forget to remember
The lone wolverine marine biologist machine
With the verbal, internal mind fertile
Foot over hurdle, tight like girdle
And my word'll be the last
I incubate every other millennium
I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of 'em
I am potent, untraceable
No color, no odor, no taste, no replaceable parts
No heart, no head, just a carcass
The darkest days come right before the light
I watch my watch and stand right before the mic
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
Caught on to the end of the rope and swung
Then stood stiff as if I was on a cliff
Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks
When I walk, my footprints indent cement
I am not practical, nor am I unusual
Nor am I oblivious to hideous crimes
Every city is captured and trapped in my mind
Given the spinal tap as the final rap climbs
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
'Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl
Master of the free pen pal style
'Cause I'm omnipotent
I'm some government experiment that is out of control
I'm from some big black hole
I square up, select, and wrecked every tangle
I flare up, and you can try any angle
Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda
Then I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen (The pollen)
That's enough of the guidelines. That's my theme music!",rap,Aceyalone_The_Guidelines.txt

That's wrong how they had they guns drawn when they run up on us
Hearse I'm under, words dem bug us, it's how they search and slug us
For wearin certain colors on the drug strip
Full of duck chick that love chips
Where I live, you get your mug split
For tryin to stunt and pose, in front of hoes
I leave a dozen froze in they cousin clothes when I come in shows
Me and my lows rock Wolverine hoods and Timbos
Everyone in my kin knows, my squadron foul
I run with opportunist problem childs
That like the robbin style, pussies that act hard and smile

Rhymin' is fundamental
Peep the game they put the youngin' into
Sprung off a instrumental, holdin' guns inside a rental
Rap is ten percent lungs, ninety percent mental
But what I want-a know is who sent you
To get on quick, rock with the team I was born with
A cash hustle, my whole staff tussle
And leave you with a bullet in your calf muscle
(One more thing) My verses crush you
Bring it to Cardan and A plus too
'Cause they think they tough Boo
If it go there, I let my staff rush you
But y'all cats better recognize
Ain't nobody seein Ali Vegas, record wise
My team, we be on Sutter duke, your team is butter new
Top talent critics is sayin Waterloo
Ali have the chickens, sayin what a cute bastard
Urban wolves got the game mastered

How my life is parallel to them inmates
Livin inside a narrow cell
The drug lords have shootouts on carousels
I done seen it all
The average baby couldn't breathe or crawl
I was watchin fiends and whores screamin brawl
Outside of convenience stores, y'all can't stand it
Half of the fam split, we lost Tash
Keith Dolla Bill, Uncle Pook Seville, and The Bandit
My music bump on every avenue, boulevard and Van Wyck
I have to sell my records with a pamphlet
So y'all cats can get the spot and muscle to find a hustle
We down to tussle, we'll clown and crush you
Mellowed out, but still a send a dime to bust you
Y'all know the code of the streets
Keep a toast when you sleep
Stick up kids be patrollin' the streets
And if you fold on your peeps
Wake up slain with holes in your Jeep

Steady causing damage with words and even syllables

Weak-ass, character misfit
You know it wouldn't last forever with endeavors
Multiple bad moves your head, you finally severed
Decapitated by the new heads of state
Whose lyrical ideologies uncover fallacies
And dynasties constructed by the morbid

Hit the blunt
Forget about her when the blunt hit ya
Who did it? Bitch, you did it
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
Ever since I been in school, they been pick and choosin'
I don't know how I go through with it, I go through with it
This is stupid
But who the fuck am I to judge bitches?
I guess I never knew how to love bitches
Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, fuck bitches
My nigga we don't fuck… with ya
So why you fuck with us?

"I want to thank the following people for everything today, everybody from the Parks Department, Adrian Benepe, John Silva, Frances Yauch, Steve Martin; but most of all I want to thank my sister Rachel. She really made this happen, and now she's gonna make me cry.
It's fitting that we're here today to dedicate a playground to Adam Yauch because like the Wu-Tang Clan, Beastie Boys is for the children. I was trying to think of what to say today, and I was thinking what it means to be a New York kid: People come to New York to be themselves, to express themselves and to be who they want to be. And although Adam's mom Frances is a New York kid herself, his father Noel came to New York to be himself. And together they raised a New York kid, Adam Yauch, and Noel and Frances raised him right. They taught Adam to be curious, thoughtful, kind and just enough crazy – that craziness that is New York. That New York frenetic energy: It's musical, artful and always moving forward. And that's not only Brooklyn, that's Adam Yauch. And Adam and his wife Dechen raised a daughter Losel, a New York kid that's equally talented, curious and utterly awesome.
In life you don't really get to chose your family, your siblings – you get what you're given. I got lucky cause I got two great sisters and two great brothers, but I got extra lucky because around 1982, I got the chance to choose two other brothers: Mike Diamond and Adam Yauch. And together our families have grown. I'd like to thank the New York Parks Department and the people of Brooklyn for honoring my friend and brother, and recognizing how cool it is to have an Adam Yauch park for other crazy New York kids.",rap,Ad-Rock_Adam_Horovitz_Speaks_At_Adam_Yauch_Park_Ceremony.txt

You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same
You can see me on the riviera dressed like a Playboy
Or you can catch me up in Rivieras Tuesday night
Pillow fights with Dominican mothers
That's what happens when theres suede on the roof
Swervin' lane to lane in a coupe
Shit, if I crash it, I'll probably just leave it as a token
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Uh, eating well so my foot's swollen
Fuck it man I'm rollin', you rollin' or not?
The boat plane's waiting at the dock
I wonder if he let me fly it, but it's a long shot
The money eases everybody's mind
Put kids through school, new titties on wives
New tits for the mistress
Fuck it, new titties for everybody, it's Christmas, yeah
I saw you standing in the rain
You were holding his hand
And I'll never be the same, no
I use milfhunter.com to ease the pain
It was ninety-two degrees with rain
Right before the seasons changed
On trees just a little bit of leaves remain
My heart broke when his cock was in your throat
But fuck that laid top out on the boat
Heard you fucked Ryan Philippine at 1 OAK
My man seen you both at the Sunoco
Kissing and touching, lied and said that this was your cousin
Shit, I should have known when you stole money
Bitch called the cop and rolled on me
So good, I got old money
To lay on any motherfucking beach on the planet
With equestrian colored salmon
We examine my life and make sure I'm never dumb again
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in

"Yah, Queens nigga
Ali Vegas
Generation gap spokesman for the youth
L.E.S., urban wolves y'all
Big things connection, yah
Yo how you going y'all check it
Yo, yo have you ever had to change huddles
Move to a differant hood see the same struggles
Crab routines got the game muffled
Old players wish to death but got the same shuffle
One move could leave your brain puzzled
That's why I stress essentials, bless the tempo
With knowledge that perfects the mental
Come to Queens see what the rest is into
I lost a round but it won't happen twice
I got emcees on their knees steady asking christ
How come when they was Ali's age they wasn't half as nice
I treat a vet just like an ap-pren-tice
Cause the words I speak is more street than crack and dice
I was put here to rap, L.E.S. let me hear the track
D.O. know I spit a verse make the snare collapse
Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped
From up north to the telly
And all my peers caught in the belly
Living life similar to bums sincere black
Another day, another dollar, another nigga in court (whats that)
That's the theme of New York
And if you dont plan to play hard
You might as well stay the hell off the court
That's the theme of New York (I ain't going nowhere)
Where the hustlers work hard for their cash and they hate taking shorts
That's the theme of New York (the system got them locked down)
And all the grimey niggas plot and scheme
To take the shit that you bought, that's the theme of New York
Aiyyo these New York City streets is hot
Even police get shot
Neighbors never speak a lot
And citizens they beef with cops
Avenues flooded with p.c. shops
And reifer spots
My place is a sneaker box
Some say I need to stop
Others ask me  when my cd drops
I tell them when they stressed to hear it
I got felons serving like me while the rest they live it
I walk the streets at night but never pivot
Only bullets swerve my words
Go through your vest and wet your spirit
Y'all critics got a lot of nerve
I'm him to the third
A new king has emerged
From out of queens by turning verbs into perfected lyrics
And tommorrow they'll say
Yo police blitzed the crack game
Drug alias switched to rap names
Fat chains attract fame
Innocent wigs get split when gats flame
Cause the ignorant mix their wits with bad aim
A young brain stormer
Hit harder than hurricane Carter
A mental sparker
We can rhyme to see whos pencil sharper
You are raps newest propaganda
Speak with smooth and proper grammer
Planets start minana
Turning cash legal
Just imagine if wanna cap people
Impregnate the rich daughter of Rich Porter
And create a crack sequel
Now thats lethal
What you say gangsta
I dont kow the plan
The system snatched half of my dynasty
I dont want to leave the city
But I know one day they'll try the real on me

"Can't believe you motherfuckers didn't think of this before
Make bitches spaz like the Plasmatics, watch this
Better get the best shit you wrote that makes 'em go wild
Shit a bitch'll put up in a AOL Profile
Download it, burn it and ship it to Kansas
To a cousin that'll pump it on a college campus
Play it at dances and translate it to Spanish
So foreign exchange motherfuckers'll understand this
Shit that'll make a chick send you her panties
Or fight with her family like, ""you don't understand me""
Raps that'll change the existence of earth
From infant to birth if mom heard the verse
Like ""what"", didn't understand it at first
So she reversed and played it until it made her brain burst
That's how it works, gotta love it 'till it hurts
Love it 'till I easily ease off skirts
Ease on your knees and I'll skeet on your shirt
Freeze on the floor now back to work
Go (back and forth)
From here to the floor
Till your bodies spasm and your feet is sore
Go (back and forth)
From here to the store
Use a box of Magnums now you need some more
Go (back and forth)
On top, make her rock, make her pop
Make it roll, make her stop 'fore you blow it then
Go (back and forth)
From here to the bar
From near or far
When you hear it in your car go
Hey what's up Beatrice
I see you standin' there with your little Coach bag
Tiffany's bracelet trying to look all pretty
That's like 250 dollars total
That's two pairs of sneakers for me
Fuck outta here

(Fight'em all), (no hold me back)
(Fight'em all), (no hold me back)
What you gonna do Ap?
(Fight'em all), (no hold me back)
Yeah nope, don't calm down yet
It's not time yet
Hold me back, fuck that, I'ma fight 'em all
If you can't find 'em, later swing by the morgue
Since nobody knows how to rock a mic no more
I'ma start teaching rappers how to write your bars
I ain't tryin' to tell nobody how to fight your wars
But fuck weapons son, I throw hooks like Jabar
I don't like any of y'all
And any of all, wouldn't give a fuck if my bank had a penny or more
Come through your crib smellin' like the scent of your whore
Give you dap with the same hand that was pettin' your whore
I admit it, I'm a sinner, broke plenty of laws
And never got scratched but I broke plenty of jaws
Listen, I'm hungry, I'm amped, I'm ready, I'm souped
Been broke too damn long son, I'm ready for loot
Once I'm more known no artist will never recoup
And I'ma spit the flow 'till I own every coupe
Go (back and forth), weed spot to the coke spot
Bring a fiend with you just to make sure the coke's hot
(Back and forth)
If she wit' you now she mine
Lover boy you should've never ever bought that half of wine
(Back and forth)
Lotta hoes on my dick, due to dough that I get, plus the flows that I spit

We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down

Think a letta like this gon kill me dude?

Shit you was lucky I was feeling you
Let me tell you what a bitch that's real will do
I remember all the things that we did in my house
Should of never left shit in my house
Get your clothes and your boots and suits nigga get em up out
You would never know what I'm about
When I'm in doubt I walk away like it's the in thing
Follow all my instincts
The henessey in ya blood got ya strong like ginseing
Who the hell you think ya pimpin?
Not me you can go
I don't care what you leaving me for
If you stay you'll be deceiving me more
Let me see what you do when you can't get your feet on the floor
You didn't think that I would even the score
Through the heat of it all
I was there for you
Cared for you
But you never gave the love back
I don't care if you a thug cat
Ain't no mothafucka ever gon treat me like a rugrat
It's niggas like you that make a bitch wanna wil' out
Put a brick through you windshield
I don't care how your fam or your fake ass friends feel
Since day one I've always been real
But you took it for granted damnit
You got me actin foul
Think you a playa international?
Got your bank card know your pin number so I'm cashin now
On some funny shit look who's laughing now
I'ma sell all the jewelry you left behind
Me being deaf, dumb, and blind
Instead of being two steps ahead I was a step behind
Thought you never gonna wreck my mind
I don't care though
You can go now
Pack your shit up
I don't need you
You messed with my mind was the worse thing you ever did
I ain't the one for the wedding ring
Your doing this for your benefit
You degenerate
Stab me in the back like a Benidect
But I blame myself for being blind for the scrub type
Should've knew from the getgo
But it's cool I can live I can learn get wise to my life
It ain't hard for me to let go
I'm a strong ass woman
Ain't no way I'm gonna be depressed
Let a nigga try to wear me down
Now the rain is gone I can see clearly now
Where my mentals at you should fear me now
Look really how
Did you think I wouldn't pay ya back
Your a bitch for the way you act
You want to be in the front while I played the back
And you think that I'm gonna be ok wit that?
That's crazy wack
You ain't never wanna help the team
Did things that I felt were mean
But I let it all go
Never paid it no mind
Even though you tried to fuck with my self-esteem
When you dealt with me you had things that you never had
Niggas knew I was your better half
Now you got a new bitch
Pray to God hope she know about me
And if not I'm gonna tell her ass
Stella had to get her groove back
Nigga move back
Who me I'm just moving on
Mary J. said the best when said that I'm not gon cry

When opportunity knock, I ran out the back door
Shit I thought it was the cops, damn
I fuck the bitch with a broom stick
The same broom that I didn't clean my room with
Stay on my toes, no ballet
Shout out my Zoe's, Sak Pase
I'm twistin' weed in my mansion
I go dumber than Lamont Sanford
Remember when moms couldn't afford Pampers
Now she trying to avoid cameras
All I do is count my blessings, Weezy F for Fortunate
I came up from that bottom, now I'm richer than chocolate
Lil Tunechi
I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
'Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)
Yeahhhh
'Cause we outchea (we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Ain't no sleepin' (ain't no sleepin')
'Cause we outchea ('cause we outchea)
And we outchea (and we outchea)
We outchea (we outchea)
Grindin' all damn night, 'cause we outchea
I say another day, another dollar
Thank the Lord for my praying mama
Watch ya back in this cold world
'Cause everybody won't see tomorrow
Money called and I'm motivated
Kill the beat, it's premeditated
Still remember like yesterday when them hard times had me frustrated
Say any day, I'ma go and get it
Pair of J's and my Florida fitted
Quittin' not in my vocab and no hate is found in my soul and spirit
Young nigga trying to feed the fam
Hatin' on me, I don't give a damn
Out here like what nigga?
You don't get the picture like Instagram
Hundred dollars to a couple grand
Couple grand to a hundred bands
Hundred bands to them big Ms
And my weight up like six gyms
I'm outchea and I mean that
We The Best, where my team at?
Bad vibes, I don't need that
I done came too far to be lookin' back
I made my way from the bottom, and I'm grindin'
I wake up every morning lookin' for commas
'Bout my dollars; I'm goin' all out
And that's on my mama, on my mama (yeeeah)
Yeahhhh
'Cause we outchea (we outchea)

Ain't no sleepin' (ain't no sleepin')

"(Ali Vegas - talking)
Rest In Peace to my nigga Mel, this song dedicated to you
Yeah, I sit back and I hear niggas saying ""Damn, Vegas you sound like this
Nigga, you sound like that nigga""
They always compare me to greats, so a nigga can't never sound wack
Cause they compare me to every nice nigga that was ever in the  game
So I wonder what them niggas be saying
Gather round hustlers, that's if you still living
Black Album dropping, who's gone fill my position
Um...It's not often I lose
Who's the next king to walk in my shoes
The prince of New York, that's an awkward dude
His walk and talk is so smooth
Vegas be the talk of the news
He might just be the one
L.O. get that lil nigga on the phone
Cause I need to speak to son now
Pistols popping at visionaries
Niggas is getting buried
Different worries, living is getting scary
Rappers rapping bout what happen
Fame and fashion, guns blasting
Bust they don't share the same passion
That's why he gone outlast em
Fasten ya seat belt, Vegas'll make a beat melt
Him against the world he don't need help
And all my niggas stuck in the pen
Ya can't deny it, he a Southsider ya don't fuck with him
Back in '99 when I first heard his CD
I looked, damn an illmatic version of me
A young'n with fame thorough with game
New ruler of the borough I claim
Thoroughest lames would huddle in gangs
Thinking bout what they gone do
Vegas keep doing ya thing
Cause can't none of these young niggas fuck with you
They having a thought of spazzing in court
Half of his rock and half of his mark to the stash of New York
Quiet when I speak to you
La put the heat to you
Real king of New York, I'm dying in my vechicle
Like Frank White, Ali Vegas got his bank tight
Now competition can't think right
Y'all all know me, I'm the one that put the mac in roni
Top of New York like T.O.N.Y
Too many niggas tried to clone me
Truly yours, prince of New York but P.O.N.Y to you homie
You know me
Uh-oh, here we go again
First time out y'all didn't notice him
Now he gets on tracks and his roasters them
Tommy Motolla and Universal is back in control again
Casa Blanca, that's like a second home for him
50 million is a lot of dough to spend on a rapper that's going to blow  again
Who wanna go toe to toe with him?
Nobody, he squeeze triggers like Eastwood
I can't say nigga, but guess what he could
It was a cold stormy nigh chilling on Flatbush Ave
That's when my man past and pulled the CD out the stash
Said I needed to blast, I pulled over the whip before I crashed
At last, prince of New York is all in ya ass
It be the same cats that wouldn't listen to his demo
Now want info, black on black limo
Flood any tempo, it's simple
Anything he drop hot, even if it pop like a pimple
Popo, now he loco
Raspberry no more coco
Ya know how fast an O go, if not you a doe doe
No more slow dough, sho dough
Hardcore no more go go
But y'all already know tho
Straight from the down, down
I hear dirty is getting right
Knew he was nice when I heard 'em on the mic
Girls holla'n E.I., niggas they wanna fight
Told dirty don't worry he gone be aiiight
I said his pimp juice got him feeling under the gun
Told 'em he got what it take to be number 1
When it's hot in here bitch niggas'll run
Don't worry about it they all gone be stunned
Naw son, Naw son, Naw son, Yo Vegas, Naw son
Ya not breaking the whole song down on these niggas
Don't let these niggas think you just doing this
Just cause you wanna sound like niggas
Word to my mother, if y'all going to compare my son
Then y'all need to compare all them niggas son
Cause all them niggas sound alike
Word to my mother from Jay to Nas, all them niggas sound alike
If you speed the nigga Jay up you get Nas
If you slow the nigga Nas down you get Pac
You take away Pac doubles, you get B.I.G
You take away B.I.G. doubles, you get Slick Rick
This is all a family tree
Y'all need to stop comparing niggas and just let niggas eat
Fuck it who knows you slow me down you might get every rapper in the  game
I might sound like the nigga Vegas when you slow me down

You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)

Yeah, hey (Come on, woo! Come on)
Ooh
If I can go with you (Uh, uh, yo, yo, uh)
If I could choose a place to go, it gotta be far away
From here, we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And if I can go with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin' like leavin' the coast too
Feelin' like leavin' with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin' the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways?
And if I can go with you
Way out the states, no two-ways and no page'
No cells and no trace and you just a phone call away, so all I got to say is
If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
""Baby, vamos,"" we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all (I hear you)
I'll get my things (Yeah), soon as you say (Talk to me)
""Baby, vamos"" (C'mon), we'll fly away
And if I could go with you
Oh boy, we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I could flow with you
The thought though, after the studio, I'll roll with you
I'll send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario, the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin', get mo' tissue (Haha)
The way me and this girl be rhymin', it's so official (Yeah)
That I'm takin' a trip, too, with no pistols (Come on)
'Cause everything peace, only sand, no streets
Little Miami heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
Ang, I'll think I'll go with you
So tell the station you need a week, back to you (Tell me, oh)
If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
""Baby, vamos,"" we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say
""Baby, vamos,"" we'll fly away
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe, take me with you, 'cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me (Yo, uh)
So now that we got a plan are you comin'? We could plan a week (Come on)
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?
And a seat, no aisle, the window, 'cause I like to see (Okay)
And seein' as to how I'm so fly, me and the clouds can speak
And since we 'bout to go in a few, go 'head
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off, I'm grateful, what was you tryin' to say, boo?
Nothin', just grab my chain off the table and two-way too
Okay, that little place is a great move (Uh)
And ain't no problems unless the water don't stay blue
And the shops there? If they don't got em, they don't make em (True)
No concrete, just sand, throw away your shoes
Now that we are on our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late (Come on)
Everything's okay, so I guess I'll catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask (Tell me, oh)
If I can go contigo
I'll pack my things soon as you say
""Baby, vamos,"" we'll fly away
Like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go contigo
I'll tell my friends nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say

"It was so beautiful
Remember how in love we were?
So in love
So in love
Once
So in love
Once
She was a young girl
I was a young man
And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand
And then I let go
The inevitable
So beautiful
And susceptible
So wonderful
And so innocent
And after this neither one of us would benefit
Yeah, I was a dropout
She was a graduate
She said I’ll never be nothing she wasn’t having it
Yeah, I tried to break her down
I tried to reason it
She said I wasn’t nobody to be believing in
Yeah, what a waste of time
What a waste of mind
Your place of mind was a part of the design
Yeah, I used to call her up
She never called back
When she called that said I wasn’t all that
Yeah, I know that times change
And people change, too
I was a fool just to think that I could change you
Everyone’s got stories gone
About a love we once knew
So high in the beginning
Until the world cuts through
And then everything changes
Nothing feels the same
Piece by piece it falls apart until
All that’s left is blame
And if I had a chance to do it all over I’d do it exactly the same
I was a b-boy
She was a good girl
Turned hot girl
Had to be a hood girl
Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world
I was like look girl it’s all in the book
Yeah, I used to tell her jokes
I used to make her laugh
And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half
So delicate
And so intelligent
And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it
Back when she was 19 not even 21
Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone
Thought that she was naive
Or was it really me
I do believe
She was the one that wasn't feeling me
So we broke up at a barbecue
Drove home thinking never will I bother you
Yeah, I just didn’t know
What it was hidden for
She had me sitting low
But she was bullshitting, though
So I just kept rhyming
I caught her eye again
Next thing you know she was hollering let’s try again
But I wasn’t buying in
Didn’t want to lie again
Love was in the frying pan
Baby, it’s done
But she started hanging out
And started being seen
Seeing things different
Said she wasn’t being mean
Yeah, if I let her in
Then I let her win
But I’m a veteran what’s better than a friend
Maybe she was an angel
But she’s in disguise
And I just didn’t see the God-light in her eyes
Or maybe I should I walk away
And cut all the ties
Stay on the rise
Leave love left where love dies
We were youngsters
But we’re older now
But the world is a little more colder now
And I’m just trying to get it all off my shoulder now
Baby, you can hold it down
I’ll see you in the wind
That’s right, baby
Next life time
Yeah, ain’t that what they say?
Check it out

I got love for you

Energetic, poetic and athletic
You know I get down and dirty when it's time to set it
I'm tearin' through, clean your scene like ammonia
I drown ya, flood four corners, the perimeter
I wonder, cause earthquakes bolts and lightning
You couldn't test the one and only Mic Titan
Afu-Ra, now you hear it, now you know it
The body of the life force came forth just to show it
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check, one, two
I hit the atmosphere, give emcees visions of comets
Technique kicked by force the earth, I hit and bomb it
Immaculate conception with the weapon
Emittin' mind bogglin' forms to mental sections
Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Throwin' shit together more iller than MacGyver
I never tire, spirit live like a wire
I came to let you know fantasies burn like desires
Before I go, on this mic I show pity
Coast to coast I whirlwind through cities
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate
Enterprising, uprising, surprisin'
Ultra-sonic, mind like bionic
Gets ya body up just like a roots tonic
It's ironic, negative broke to north
I hit the crowd up and scorch off like Molotov
Stadiums is ripped in half, the diameter
Of area, mathematics, straight up scarin' ya
Face to face, cheek to cheek, eye to eye
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
So they kick it 'bout the finer things in life
Yes rings is nice yes but knowledge skills be priceless
And so I radiate platinum, diamonds luster
Flavor, perform unique, my cosmic saber
As the legend's told, the heavens cradled my birth
Time to get down for my crown and show you what it's worth
My energy level's about to reach the proximity
Perverted monk, I whirlwind through cities
Friends prefer to call him just plain God
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate
The intentions of reminiscence is essential
On how I had dreams of a youth, now monumental
It's comin' true, things I've said have come to pass
And MCs would get busy but still won't get no cash
Some talents get the stash with skills as half as yours
It's not about styles it's what the crowd you has applaused
This unified circle, slip up it hurts you
So I spread forth and my thoughts make miracles
With my syllables I'm killin' you, but never softly
I'm unique, my critique speaks of my physique
From Chicago to Cairo, skills like the mic
On MCs I make 'em think that I was Hiero-
Glyphics, now the whole world can read the message
Fake emcees couldn't walk through my passage
Afu-Ra, shake the world with agility

Far as I'm concerned that Hollywood shit's for fags
Keep it real dawg, post up with the steel dawg
Kick it with real hop, with real balls

I still get bucks and watch Christoph Spiel
Cuz I could care less whether I'm broke or not

Ima cop that jag, and drop that rag

Hit the weed, and bump in-between the sheets

Fuck that, put your mouth where my nuts at, suck that
Spit on wax, with 16 bars
Then jump on tracks, like I'm a track star
We all got straps, no need to act hard
We can get our scraps on, in my mama's back yard

Went from, shootin' up cars to a hood ghetto star
Bet ya never thought Glocc could make it this far

Switch from Jerry curled backs to Wayne caps
And now the new fact fresh braids to the back huh?
And everybody rockin' silver like it's platinum
Stop it dawg, what the fuck wrong with y'all?
If you can't afford the real don't cop it at all
You can't ball and be broke
Spend up all your come up money
And wonder why you keep coming up short
I don't know what it is, what the fuck is this?
C'mon that shit on your wrist's faker than silicone tits
You need to quit, seek a role model to follow
One that can teach you, the means of a dollar
See you? You spend your last buck on weed

Won't you play it for me. In the mix mister hop
Forward hop back. Hop, hop hop
The second somebody dies somebody else is born
People are celebrating while other people mourn
Home may be home to you but to me it's foreign
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns
One man's enemy is another man's friend
One man's poisons is another man's medicine
So let us stand, let us sit and let us view
The changing of the guard oh it's so hard to keep it true
It's the balance of the scales it can't be challenged or expelled
Soon as somebody lost somebody else prevails
Someone is quiet at the same time someone yells
Half full or half empty water in the well
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
It's the Half and Half Hypothesis the 50/50 theory
Eerie as it may seem check your balance beam
Now check your Balance Beamer with a feather and a rock
Whether or not you find the answer is really not the plot
See it's like love and hate (love...and hate)
The same emotion, different weight
People love to hate, so I know you know, just how this all relates
It's the posa- and the nega-tive, mini and mega live
Arm, a leg, a leg, an arm, headed by a nigga
Like big and small, short and tall
Night and day and so on, some people are bashful
Some people just love to get their flow on (they flow on)
So here goes one to grow on
I'm a go on and on and on, till the principles are laid out
The scales of justice weighed out, 'til your memory starts to fade out
And your game of life is played out, got to balance out the power, don't we?
Balance your emotions, push and pull positions
Like the moon pulls on the ocean, balance on one foot, that's equilibrium
Opposites attract and retract, that's a fact (I'm a Libra y'all!)
180 degrees, but not that hot
So whether or not you find the answer, is really not the plot (really not the plot)
Because, giving is receiving (and) and seeing is believing (and)
And the solar system, rotates so harmonious and even
It's perfectly balanced
Some people say life is about taking chances, choices and decisions
Voices and opinions, politics and religion
Clues to the past and cash and keys to the future
It's a possibility and probability, on who's gonna execute yo ass
Some slow and analytical, some quick fast on the dash
Like heads or tails, but the head usually leads the tail
So I tell my tales from the head, cause they're embedded inside my cells
Real quick, let me tell you about a fact, I know things will even out
You can disbelieve or doubt, or even shout, or leave it in your mouth
Cause, how you gone reason with grand, Mother Nature?
Running Mother Earth, controlled by Father Time, who's the chaser?
It's living and dying homey, laughing and crying dude
Trying or lying my brother, walking or flying fool
Now half of you are gone, find the time to shine
The other half? 'Gon' find crime, money, weed, wine
Till it's too late, in a disillusion state of mind
I just found my peace of mind, now they want a piece of mine
Too late in a disillusion of mind
The orthodox is the unorthodox, they just got you on the names
The insane and the sane, are the same
It's a damn shame, so many people's aim is so lame
And their gain is so minimal, caught up in the subliminal
It's pleasure and pain, water for the flames, the wild and the tame
The style still remains, if you use the right side of your brain
Instead of going against the grain, you can penetrate the vein
To the point where what remains is a stain, of this universal thang That we call Balance (balance)..",rap,Aceyalone_The_Balance.txt

And drag em back to Project Blowed
Hold as many mics as I can possibly hold
And rip up the session after the last rapper flowed
I never fold, even though my pokerface is old
The world's cold, probably why I stay in battle mode
I would love to touch your ego
European, latin or negro
Rap Evil Knievel, but I ain't evil
It's all nice, especially with the mic device
When it's in my hand it's like throwin the trick dice
It's the worldwide underground heist
And what I'mma give back is more than suffice
Pour me over ice and drink to think
You're only as strong as your weakest -
I dwell amonst the deepest
As long as there's speakers I make songs for the peoples
I push the ink, who gives a f what they think
It's tight now, wait until I iron out the kinks
It's tied down, wait until I iron out the kinks
..Wait until I iron it all out, it's gon' be cool
But like I said I want everybody to be able to do they thing successfully
This goes out to all you shallow rappers
Bottom-of-the-bottle rappers
Spit-and-swallow rappers, hollow rappers
Love-to-follow rappers, Apollo rappers
And rah-rah rappers, yeah, all that, yeah
To all you Big Willie rappers, silly rappers
'My-mack-milli' rappers, smoke-a-Philly rappers
Illy-illy, killy-killy rappers
Not really rappers
Yeah, all you signed rappers
Blind-to-what's-goin-on-behind rappers
Crime rappers, 'I'm-in-my-prime' rappers
Part-time rappers, one of a kind rappers, too
Yeah, you wanna go around the world, but you got a half tank
You wanna paint a perfect picture but ain't got no paint
But I'm the painter with the brush and the easel
I like to rush em and I hit em with the ??fleezle??
I got a stick of dynamite, you got a stick of gum
He tried to chew it up before I blew it up, it's done
It's done, it's done, it's done...

Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets

Only a particularly menacing
Angle perpendicular to everything
Boys room cherry bomb
Boy/goon very much runnin' with the devil in the mellotron
Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
Silhouette,  the god’s last cigarette

"At this point Flex wanted to make sure that we made the most of this moment and that, as a station, we owned it: ""We're gonna bring Battle of the Beats back, Ang!!!! We're gonna let the city decide who wins this!!! And we're gonna do it on your show tomorrow!""
My show? Why?! Flex said my voice was one of authority, and the contest could start at night with his show and could go into the day and end with me in the afternoons when I would announce the winner. The thought made me uncomfortable, but Flex convinced me that with Power looking to capture our audience it was important to remind people that if it happens in hip-hop, it happens here. And he reminded me if we didn't do it, someone else would. So I agreed. Although I didn't know how the vote was going to go, you could feel the Nas wave building
In all this, Nas was being portrayed as the real MC, the underdog. What I've noticed in our culture is that everybody roots for the underdog, myself included. The only thing about the underdog theory that bothers me is for some reason we feel the need to knock somebody down to build someone else up. In general, this is something that has always irritated the shit out of me. It's such a terrible, dysfunctional way to treat anyone successful who comes from where we come from. I have always made it a point not to subscribe to that mentality. We should celebrate success and be inspired by it, even while we're championing someone new. But nobody wants to hear that shit when you're in the middle of a battle
We sat there and hand-counted the votes until the winner was clear—sixty percent of our listeners chose ""Ether"" over ""Super Ugly."" As much as it irritated me to hear the venom toward Jay, I agreed that ""Ether"" was the better of the two records. I'm literally getting ready to announce the winner when I look into the hallway of the station and see Jay Z walking into my studio. ""And the winner is 'Ether.'"" I had to deliver Jay that blow while he was standing right there
To say he was uncomfortable is an understatement. I couldn't really figure out why he'd agreed to be interviewed in this moment. But evidently he had been under pressure. Like I said, a lot of people felt he had gone too far. Even his mother felt that way. She was the one who suggested that he apologize for getting a woman and a child involved by even mentioning them
I can see him sitting there like it was yesterday—defeated. I had never seen him like that before. He's somebody who's always so big and confident. And I hated to see him down. This is a friend, and I was a part of the machinery that brought him to this point
After the interview, we walked outside the studio to talk alone. ""Yo,"" I said. ""Are we okay?""
""Of course. I don't blame you for this,"" he said. ""This was just something that you kind of got sucked into. I'm clear. It's cool.""From MY VOICE: A Memoir published by arrangement with Celebra, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

"Young Chop on the beat
Real shit
Dear heavenly father
I come to you today
To remove all these evil spirits
Keep us out of harm’s way
Never allow us to die broke
I pray for them children who woke up this morning and lost they life
How dare the government passin’ these laws to remove the Christ
As soon as a tragedy happen the person you call is God
Now people obeyin’ and prayin’, they prayin’ I’m sayin’ it’s odd
Fuck the world – the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
But sit back and pray as we watchin’ the news and we take the abuse
What train of thought is tellin’ you shoot up a movie theatre?
What kind of fool gon’ walk in a school and off them angels?
It could me my moms, my brother or sister, a friend that I knew
The funny thing is, it could’ve been me, it could’ve been you
I’m tired of people complainin’ about the little shit
When I just lost my grandmother to that cancer bitch
You woke up this morning – why the fuck is you mad?
You broke as a joke – get up off your ass
I hustle like niggas is broke even though I be countin’ the cash
I gotta get it – like I’m down to my last
Put that on my mama, don’t wanna go through them tears again
‘Cause when you are broke, it’s nobody there, including your friends
Lord knows… the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope…
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope
Fuck the world – the government too
I’m keepin’ it real, them killers are still in political suits
And I hate it, it’s people, it’s nothin’ my brother or sister could do
You can hate it or love it, but youngin’ I’m simply speakin’ the truth
I woke up this morning and I got the news that my homie was shot
Out on the block and in front of his daughter, believe it or not
Good people are sayin’ and prayin’ for innocent murders to stop
We livin’ in Hell and it’s easy to tell some people are shocked
Who are you people to judge me ‘cause of the way that I live?
The way that I grind, the things that I did, the person I am
Everyone got opinions but niggas as broke as a joke
I went to them schools and spoke to the children that need it the most
I gave away toys, I gave ‘em a speech, delivered ‘em hope
It’s a blessing to become a blessing, my mama would set it in stone
Fuck these niggas hatin’ on me
Hate is such a weak emotion
And money is the root of evil
But that’s that shit that keeps me focused
Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m a father
No pain can describe on how to reside with losin’ a daughter
Fuck this world – the ignorance too
They want me to fall, but still I continue to lace up this shoe
Society’s being misleaded, I’m simply giving you proof
Them people is sellin’ these lies, I’m simply speakin’ the truth
Lord knows… the realest shit I ever wrote
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope…
But through all the bullshit I throw up a sign of hope
Fuck the world – the government too

All she ever wanted was that thug loooooove
Thug love, thug love
All she ever wanted was that thug, love
Yo, hey yo, uhh
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh
Aiyyo I met him at a club, spendin dubs, Mr. Superthug
Pulled up with a group of trucks, everybody knew who he was
I ain't playin the boy was cute, and I'm sayin
We only danced one song but the whole night I was swayin
Mesmorized by his style, could tell he was wild
But he had a touch of class and a million buck smile
Got a thing for a thug and he fit the profile
Thug love, think I'm buggin brother let me know now
Yo.. yeah, uhh
Yo, yo..
What's his name, what's the color of his Range, what's his game?
Was he kickin it like he love his train, full of octane?
Stop playin, know you ain't fall for that
(Yo he's pagin me) Ang' don't even think of callin back
Man I know those cats, him and his click be flowin crack
Up in Prominax(?), stickin them kids, by the laundromat
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply
Fuckin with them dudes that's trife, you lose your life
{*Interlude*}
It's a thug love
Searchin for love in the wrong places
A thug love
Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Even though he ain't right for you
Joe I like this dude, I need advice from you
It's a thug love
Searchin for love in the wrong places
A thug love
Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Even though he ain't right for you
Yo yo, uhh, uhh, yo
- overlaps {*Interlude*} but comes in on line three
I just can't explain why women are attracted to danger
A thug and a player look the same in linen but one's packin a banger
I guess it's the anger that be in they eyes
Mixed together with a pinch of they sensual side that gets me energized
Fly and confidant, respected and highly dominant
Got me on the rise every time he draw me with compliments
Joey I'm fallin for a thug, should I sacrifice
Or let it go brother you never gave me bad advice
It's only right that I let you know which route to go
No doubt fo' sho', once he hits it, he's out the do'
Know I seem like a cock-blocker, but he's not proper
Besides you're my little sis, I gotta watch ya
Gotta stop you from dealin with snakes
You're sealin your fate let alone I feel it's your wake
Eliminate all the wrongs in your life
Don't you fall for them guys, like Pun says, it's all in the eyes
{*Interlude*} +
I only speak on what I know, he cheats, he gotta go
You think he ain't gon' creep (not at all)
That's a damn shame, I see you fallin for this man's game
The truth is even if he want it man he can't change
That's the life of a player livin lies like the mayor
Hittin them thighs, be wise and beware
But don't be surprised, one day you'll find a decent guy
Someone that cares and provides a piece of mind
I know you right, but I'm torn inside
I got a jonz for a boy that was born to ride
My only vice(?), saw the guy, leave my momma mortified
It's no surprise, it happens all the time
Got me stressin and I'm comin back for me
Got me, checkin my messages expectin him to call
I need to, let it go need to stay focused
But can't, forget him yo so I remain hopeless

Thank God I keep the meat tenderizer in my cabinet
But truthfully (what?), my vision varies
I go from a visionary to a vicious leader of killer militaries
Usin' old machine guns, why I need better gats?
These’ll still burn holes in motherfuckers like a treasure map (Blat!)

This is the Demigodz gospel
Unholy and hostile, acidic apocalyptic apostles

I wanna get so high

Until the day that I die
""Smoke weed everyday""
She told me I should write a song so she can smoke
And the fact I rap and that I don’t is an on-going joke
As she lit and took a toke she choked a little then she spoke
She said she buy so much weed it’ll probably make her broke
But life is heavy, bills are big, and bitches always stress her
So she keeps a bag of trees under her panties in her dresser
She looks so fucking sexy with a blunt between her lips
So I always cop her dutches from the store on my trips
And she can tell what kinda shit you smokin' by the smell
And music sounds better to her when she’s high as hell
She grew up playin' Cypress Hill and to the death
She said her last dying breath would be to puff with Meth
The cheeba cheeba queen, super reefer fiend
Marijuana mama, arteries that bleed green
I swear to God and pray she’ll never ever get away
'Cause she, 'cause she, 'cause she...

Yeah, I’m huffin', I’m chiefin', jumpin' off the deep end she fiendin'
'Cause I’m off the top when I speak it and she smoke a lot just like me
And we break it down then we roll, we smoke the pot like a stove
Like we cookin' but we bookin' from the cops on the low
Friends be laughin' and crackin' jokes in the room full of smoke
I keep an O everywhere I go, she know I'ma blow
A couple more of these and we gonna need some snacks from the store
Hey bro-bro, I got the dough-dough, we drinkin', don’t forget the 4-0's
And the Zig-Zags low-pro, fuck the po-po’s
I swing a four door, shit lookin' like a showboat
And we in high definition, watch your wishes go up in smoke
Like Cheech, I ain’t talkin' about Chong
Be real, I’m sneakin' hits from the bong
We know that it’s right when e'rybody say it’s wrong
I’m on cloud nine, fuck around and I'ma buy me a farm of that bomb

Smoke something, biatch!
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich
Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters (rats)
Roll with sinners — A bunch of winners, catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty?
Drop a hook and then I’ll probably cop an M3
Long knife ('chete), that’s in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they’ll be sent
Oh, off the strength, caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
With the CCM tacks, my feet are like Cassius
Smoke premium cabbage
Blow a kiss to my dick, wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit, on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man, we both will﻿ be rich
Yo we 80,000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns, owls, Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas, pullin' up Volkswagen jettas

Man, I’ve thought about suicide a hundred times
But I'd hate to disappoint and see my momma cry
Birthdays these days be the worst days
'Cause I know I’m getting older and not happier
Me and my father love each other, but we barely show it

And that's word to the woman who had my heart beatin' drums (Drums, drums)
Yeah, love is what I cherished and Ms. Parrish (Yeah)
Flew all the way to Paris and we made out on my terrace (Yeah)
I kept it on the low-low, 'cause I was in love (Love)
And the shade I had in my room was already enough ('Nuff)
I'm going on some dates, and I'm making some plans
But it's hard to find some love if the girl is a fan (Fan)
And after we fuck, she want a picture with me
She got me feeling like Paper Boi, but I cry when she leaves, yeah

""You know, in school everyone does their very best to learn good habits. So we're going to try to do the very same thing, as we sing...""
All star quarterback, varsity letter, I drive a Jetta
A popular kid, my parents give me all my cheddar
Plus I date Heather, the flyest girl in our school
I got a very large house, with an in-ground pool
I rock Polo and Abercrombie & Fitch, I'm rich
Pompous and arrogant, makin' fun of nerd cliques
You motherfuckin' freaks and geeks are all dumb
With ya painted white face, and pierced nose and tongue
I pass my classes with ease and get a ""A""
Cheatin', 'cause if I don't pass, I don't play
I'll shove you in ya lockers and I'll get in ya face
Put you in ya place, 'cause you fuckin' nerds are a waste of air
Black clothes, blank stare, dyed hair
You could die tomorrow and nobody would care
I'll knock you on the ground when all the halls are crowded
But you're just a wimp, whatchu gonna do about it?
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more ""F's""
No breath inside your chest
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more... school
Four years of high school, I can't believe it's here
My senior year, waiting for the crowd to cheer
At graduation, I haven't decided my occupation
But my major in college is gonna be communications
I'm nice to everybody at school, whether cool, or uncool
I'm neutral an outstanding pupil, like my teachers say
I never missed a single day
Always on the honor roll, never less than an ""A""
I help jocks with their grades, even that jerk Jeff
Who's an ass, but never would of passed class with an ""F""
Kids he picks on are smaller then him, and smarter than him
Never larger or taller than him
But this one kid named Jay, that Jeff calls gay
And beats up, doesn't look very normal today
So I give a little smile and he gives one back
Then he walks by and reaches into his knapsack
I feel like I wanna run, but my whole body's stunned
I can't believe it, but Jay's got a... (huh!)
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more ""F's""
No breath inside your chest
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more... school
My name is Jason, a real big fan of death
I sit home thinkin' of Jeff and I take a deep breath
How I'd love to fire 30 slugs into his chest, till nothin' is left
I'm always frustrated with stress, I want respect
Back when I was 6, I'd dissect insects and spray house pets with Windex
I'm Beelzebub on drugs, the intellect of a David Berkowitz roamin' on the internet
I'm sick of gettin' pushed around and bein' clowned
When I'm the most powerful evil being in town
I wake up at 5:30 and stare into space
Walk into my parents room and shoot 'em both in the face
Take a shower get dressed load my weapon for school
Walk through the hall, step over the large blood pool
On the bus with a semi-automatic in my knapsack
Smile on my face, as I sit in the back
Then I step into the buildin' and I almost feel invincible
Wave to the nurse, say hi to the principal
Walk to to my locker, everything seems slow
Then I see Jeff... and here we go
Weapons out the bag, people stop speakin', girls shriekin'
I start shootin' rounds till Jeff's chest is bleedin'
His head explodes then I start to reload
Nobody can hurt me now 'cause I'm in murder mode
Fire at everybody that's directly in my sight
But layin' on the ground is somebody that I like
This girl who I've known who's always nice and talks to me
Crawls to me, coughin' up blood and awkwardly
Whispers two words right before her head drops
She opened her mouth and said, ""Please, stop""
I could never begin to describe the way I felt
I dropped to my knees, turned the gun on myself
And pulled the trigger

Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, ""I love you"", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
We switch the flow up, if you a busta I'ma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it

Runnin' out of pages in your passport

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass
Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine
And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""

Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man, you know
That got that one good girl, dawg, that's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so

I'm so lonely
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, 'cause I'm so

How you say my love in spanish? (Mi amor)
(How you say my love in thug) Can I hit it raw?
In the backseat of my jeep, or maybe on the floor
(Easy papi) Nah mami, teach me more
(Tr'teme especial means treat me special)
I ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso
(Wanna keep a good girl like I told you before)
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more
I like fast cars, I love faster chicks
You don't need a small waist, I take ass and tits
Love chicks that deep throat, love bein left alone
On a Sunday afternoon with the remote
Love havin my cake plus eatin it too
Shit, I got cake what the fuck I'm 'posed to do
Like chicks to dress, but I love a good shoe
Sophisticated mama with love for the hood too
Love sexin girls on that boricua shit
Love black girls that's when the Levi's fit
Chicks that play hard to get on that Aaliyah shit
If at first I don't succeed, then believe I split
Can you blame me? Young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me
Moms allowed it, daddy was about it (Bout it)
Game got inherited
Mama said if you find love you better cherish it
Teach me!

I ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso
(Wanna keep a good girl like I told you before)
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more
I like to slow dance, I like to romance
I like to.. stroll through the park holdin hands
Ask me how my day was, tell me ""Ma lookin pretty""
On Sundays in the cut watchin ""Sex and the City""
Havin long talks and good lovin in the mornin
Walk them dogs when my body is callin
Flesh air force cuts a wound with a line
No stress of course, cause I don't have the time
Like to wine and dine but please hold your liquor, cuz
I'm rollin with ya and I hate a silly nigga
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it
You buggin out of line on that thug shit is nothin
Dealt with cats before that I had to train
Dealt with cats that's poor and a cat with fame
One who played basketball and I had more game
So por favor, papi stay in your lane
How you say my love in spanish? (Mi amor)

Pass me the bong
Fill up my cup
Fill it up with Patron

We just came to party
And I'm feelin' good
I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose
Your man grillin' and he just stepped on my tennis shoes
I think he mad we gettin' checks like my (???)
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue
I just came to party
Pulled up
In my old school, with the naughty
Valet park
My shit, next to 40's

In the Coup, he look sporty (He ridin' three piece)
And I'm tryin' to leave tonight, with at least three freaks
Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth

"We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go
And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades
We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go
And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

I crawled down to the basement
When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up
And memories of you
1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires
Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door

"Feel this, feel this
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house
S-T, Supreme Teacher, read you like a preacher
Seat you down, make you pay close attention to my ether
My aura illuminates, removin' the snakes, who lay and wait
Lovin' to hate, but we still elevate
Massagin' the brain, utilize the wisdom contained
Through the knowledge of my circumference and how to maintain
Some nights I, walk with the understandin', build cypher
Like Charles Bronson, vigilante ready to snipe ya
Ignite the marijuana, roll a cigar from Havana
Tony Santana, smokin' in the Coco Cabana
Or in the sauna, after doin' my calisthenics
Universal metrics, reversin' the hex, cursin' the sexist
Acceptin' my blessings, rememberin' my lessons
Take my dog's suggestions when he told me keep my Smith & Wesson
For protection, the streets is watchin', and they testin'
They know when you're frontin', and when you're representin'
It's not where you be, or how you be
Or who you be, or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds is hot
We comin through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now who you be, and where you be?
You wanna get, with, the brothers that's the illest?
The microphone, have sex with my lyrics
Hit shit off, first move is doggy style
No premature ejaculation, last for a while
Flippin' and turnin' and splittin' it, all type positions
Grabbin' and tuggin' and yokin' it, all type of missions
Crazy - nah, I'm not that type of brother
My verses, when they out in the streets, they carry rubbers
I heard you're drippin', your rap style got gonorrhea
Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Seven days around the clock ass all in the videos
I know you like it, I do too, love the cheese, yo
But this is Hip-Hop, stop it, go make a porno
Not player-hatin', on the mic, I'm player-scrapin'
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
I bounce styles that's sexual, plus I'm intellectual
Thoughts transverse to physical, I keep it spiritual
I got the motts, you bust the dutch, I got the hydro
I just sit back on tracks and let it flow
It's never where you be, or how you be
Or who you be, or what you got
Unique sounds, grounds are hot
We comin' through, we tidal waves in this rap shit
Now how you be, now where you be?
Who you be?
I give you agony, agony, agony, you wanna rump with me?
Constantly, constantly, constantly, rollin' a Phonta leaf
You know it's beef, when you gettin' stomped losin' teeth
Because you sweet and you ain't got no claims to the street
You'se the type to get shot and go explain to the cops
Come to court every day, make sure a nigga get locked
But I thought you had that big Glock, that you bust a whole lot
Then why my nigga's sittin' up, in that little cell block?
I'm tellin' ya, ock, the world is a spot for snid-akes
Niggas who hid-ate, do anything to get the pid-apes
Love to see me down and out, blood in my mouth
Steez all sweated out, tied up in my house
Can I live and still give, take my team on sprees?
Twistin' out skeeze out of custom drop-top V's?
You know the pedigrees, always stay blowin' the dick
When B.G.S. is the squad, dice stay on the six
Nuff of dem still in di valley of dry bones
Dem ah search dem Seven Seas, dem ah throw stick and stone
M-mh, dey gonna melt like snow cone
Da minute di countdown say dis ah di final showdown
Well some ah said dem ah star, dem love car
Dem at war, and a blur, dem nah really reach far
But nuff ah dem ah buffoon, dem ah goon
Cartoon, dem nah put out no conscious tune
A-fi warn dem, if dem nah listen, so we scorn dem
We gonna steer far from dem
I know that we are kings and we love nice things
But we not sell out fi no diamond ring
Yo, I got da Lord in ah mi mind
So any which part mi come, mi ah go shine
Trust me, we don't fear nothin'
So don't boost up yourself like you are gon' do me somethin'
Mi turn dem off like mi turn of mi light
Jah control di better part of mi life",rap,Afu-Ra_D&D_Soundclash.txt
"Perverted Monks style
'99 style, know what I'm saying?
Coming at ya, this how we do
Paraplegic, my fighting stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks, too much Chi, horrific
To be specific, I'm coming through with jujitsu
Bone crushing, bone breaking as I get into
Scorpion styles with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be the
Blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damaging nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you're tryna test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains, reading scrolls
Holding it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture, deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinning kicks, side kicks and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combining two styles on the mic with Masta Killa
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combining two styles on the mic with Masta Killa
The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell, keep it moving factor
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber
Eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bed-Stuy, Wing Chung from Lafayette
Stuyvesant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featuring Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Beez disease
Home grown, flown from overseas, city under siege
Your eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combining two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all, had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies, did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open, now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Rockin' very loose pants, yeah
Buried a million in the sand, by the clock tower
Before I die, take a hot shower
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
Ride the Harley into the sunset
By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Shit, I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo, it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter, steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck, I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen (Got to take it for the team)
Bite the eel by the dozen
Pump the bass in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost 80 grand
And I'm crazy tan, from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot ""Land the plane,"" on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces, my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin MAC-11s with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths, that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't hear ya

Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow

Block wheel style like, ""Whee!""

"Wipe your feet when you step in my house (Queens nigga)
Queens got shit on lock (Ali Vegas) (no doubt watch yo mouth)
*Repeat
(Ali Vegas)
Yo Ali where you from, I'm from Jamaica, Queens
Where they beat you up and take your jeans
Most of them kids'll put a toast in your ribs, if you make a scene
For the grace of green, fakes and fiends
Can't wait to meet and scheme on ways to erase your team
Only my fam and God knows how much I damage y'all flows
A live vet, die tech reference from camouflage foes
On tough nights I let my heat fire
Shorty stoned scuff nights over the street wire
He said this work'll be deranging, stressing
I had to sit him down and explain the lesson
I told him never change direction, just maintain perfection
Cause every time you lose faith your foes gain a blessing
Now Ali'll catch reck against your best vets
On cold nights I rest fresh techs inside of Guess sweats
For them killers sending death threats
A young Queens nigga getting money
So y'all think people make decisions for me
Chorus
(Ali Vegas)
Yo in the summer time beats bang
Police blame street gangs that speak slang when the heat flames
Stick up kids creep through when it's nice out, people with ice out
Queens niggas build on facts and escape through precise routes
A bunch of shot landers, running from that supercop Amanda
Nobody can't stand her
In '94, the grimmey whore got my family
Shipped me down to Atlanta
I came back the streets praised me
Now I raise guns on killers who raised me
To all you teens rushing through, I'm crushing you
I ain't huggable or lovable, I'm just a young Queens nigga that's untouchable
But still I get shown lots of love
We never had bubble coats, we had to double coats and wear socks as gloves
In fights and scuffles you get temporarily scarred with a knife
But in a struggle you get mentally scarred for life (what)
Chorus
(Ali Vegas)
I share brief conversations with my street congregation
Before I meet with either God or Satan
I flee of conflagration
In fatigues and walibees Ali's the prodigy
Who flow futuristic like Nostradamus prophecies
Knowledge equality, now it hurts my pops to see
The most greatest prophets acknowledge me for street survival
My Queens Odyssey never repeat the Bible
We cock and squeeze when we meet with rivals, Police is trife too
Wolves give me beats to write to
Ali's the pharoah summoned by the most prolific gods that comes complete to cycle
Now things are starting to get more drastic
The Bronx mothered hip-hop but Queens fathered this rap shit
(What?!)

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up

Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same

Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Y'all catch a thirty-second flash visual
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split ridiculous
Fathom the splicing of first-generation fuck-up
With trickle-down anti-hero smack (Kraken!)
I pace my game for zero hour completion cretin, splash
Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen
I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
If you'd stop following me round the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)
Then I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed
So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em (Uh)
His origami dream is beautiful
But man, those wings will never leave the ground
Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop

Slacker-bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse (Pulse)
Shimmy across the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed
Divvy crumbs for the better souls
Put seven deadly stains, and hear the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating zen up in pen-dragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the badge gleam sparkled in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman
You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests (Nope)
Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess (Haha)
Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold
Stomach full of halo kibbles
Wings span cast black upon vigils
Here to Duck Hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels
I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his little lost passion
I told him: ""Yeah,"" but only when I pedaled past him
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day

The Grand Leveler...
The Grand Leveler...
I strike a pose with the pistol grip, pussies gettin' pistol whipped
Positive and negative I'm on that Dark Crystal shit
Crystallized bodies like exposure to liquid ice
Lived inside a ghetto in Hell but got evicted twice
The man and the myth, I'm Hiram Abiff
I'll resurrect Jesus myself and buy him a spliff
I build pyramids, parallel portals to other worlds
Married to Mary Magdalene but still fuck other girls
The widow's son, the wickedest one
So get your North Face motherfucker the winter's begun
I summon winds, walls of water taller than towers
Gather your pallbearers, I'm burying all you cowards
The merciless Ming, Connecticut's king
Archangel who was born on this earth with no wings
When Gabriel’s horn sings and the Father returns
I'll cook a marshmallow on a stick while your soul burns
The grand leveler
The Grand Leveler...
The Grand Leveler...
The Grand Leveler...
Three is the magic number, the stars on the belt of the hunter
The pyramids of Giza that were built directly under
The knocks on the door that signify it's my brother
We spread light in winter then go dark for the summer
I'm absent minded, sippin' on green Absinth
Unlock my brain then travel through Pan's Labyrinth
Lab full of beakers and bubbling Bunsen burners
Dungeon full of murderers chained to the steel girders
Gods peer through telescopes, heavenly observers
Aliens visit earth and brought us stone workers
Stargates and black holes, angels and black crows
All do the same job, they transport souls
Anunnaki came to the planet to take gold
These have been the ways since the days of old
3 wise men, 3 kings et cetera
The Dog Star emperor, Orion nebula

Tell the pilot
Land in the middle of the ghetto
I'm still here

Make all your troubles disappear

Let's pop a bottle bring in the New Year

It's Akon he don't drink
Money pouring out the bank
Flip a coin what to take
Occupate what you make

Hold on wait a minute, baby, listen
I don't wanna wait, no way
Girl, don't blame me if things change
Things are getting crazy
Show me if you're ready, ready, ready

And I don't wanna be second on the team

What I gotta say?
What I gotta do to show?
Do we gotta move or take things slow?

Grind a little, tell me who it's for
Baby, just touch a littlе, drink a little
We should just get close
Baby just work the middle, grind a little
Work the middle, grind a little
Work the middle, grind a little
Tell me who it's for
I don't wanna rush it now (Mmm)
Maybe this could be something
Show me a little something, baby
I'll leave it up to you if we should take things slow
Ride the wave you know (Ah)
Won't find any cameras where we go
We can skip the facetime
Take it straight to playtime, what you need?

"Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
And there were colors pouring out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

"Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue
So many women wanna call me 'baby'
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and, uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and, uh
That's me, and you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go
You'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl, I'm blue
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties are  all saggy in your early twenties
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (Igh!)
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
