I'm different, yeah, I'm different (Yeah)
I'm different, yeah, I'm different
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga, live it up (Up)
I'm different, yeah, I'm different

I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Even if you feel like you really love her

We post up, we don't do the race, you gon' die today
Niggas runnin' out they mouth, but they never pop out
All my niggas really gang bang, talk that damn slang
Need the drugs? I'm the Xan man, I'm the damn man

Even look good with them clothes on, it's so on, lil' mama so grown
Here you fuckin' with the right guy
She drop it low, make me wanna throw some D's on it (Hey)
Young boss baby, I treat you, treat you to the finer things
