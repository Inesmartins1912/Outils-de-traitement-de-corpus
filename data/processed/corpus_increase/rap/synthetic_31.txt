Comet, I vomit up the astronomic on the daily
Big-city rappers, country rappers, greedy rappers
All you hood rappers, misunderstood rappers
I get to wellin on em from the dome

I love money, I don't love bitches
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Slow down, don't rush
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
Slow down, don't rush

Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh
Yo, hey yo, uhh
