Scum Gang!
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
She wanna fuck, but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh

I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Even if you feel like you really love her

No more detentions no more "F's"
No more teachers dirty looks
I'll shove you in ya lockers and I'll get in ya face
Four years of high school, I can't believe it's here

They feelings come and go like when they weave in
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
