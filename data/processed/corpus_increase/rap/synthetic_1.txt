I just want you to call my phone
I really wanna make things right
For my own (To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely

Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
It's ironic, negative broke to north

You might as well stay the hell off the court
Some say I need to stop
Turning cash legal
Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped

No more detentions no more "F's"
No more teachers dirty looks
I'll shove you in ya lockers and I'll get in ya face
Four years of high school, I can't believe it's here
