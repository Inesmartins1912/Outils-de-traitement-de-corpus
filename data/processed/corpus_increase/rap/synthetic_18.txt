Bond No. 9 that's my favorite scent, yeah
Rest in peace to my nigga Doe (Troup)
Hair Weave Killer
Drop top, no hot box

Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
La la la la

'Cause great scenes might be great
It's lookin' like it's 'bout time (Shee), to fuck it up (Work)
Bad, bad thang, thang, bad, bad, bad, b-b-bad
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear

We gotta start makin' changes
You gotta operate the easy way
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
Well hey, well that's the way it is
