And we in high definition, watch your wishes go up in smoke
"Smoke weed everyday"
We know that it’s right when e'rybody say it’s wrong
I keep an O everywhere I go, she know I'ma blow

Take it straight to playtime, what you need?
And I don't wanna be second on the team
Filling up the space where you should be
Pull up and come see me now

Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Keep-keep ya head up)

I can see him sitting there like it was yesterday—defeated. I had never seen him like that before. He's somebody who's always so big and confident. And I hated to see him down. This is a friend, and I was a part of the machinery that brought him to this point
We sat there and hand-counted the votes until the winner was clear—sixty percent of our listeners chose "Ether" over "Super Ugly." As much as it irritated me to hear the venom toward Jay, I agreed that "Ether" was the better of the two records. I'm literally getting ready to announce the winner when I look into the hallway of the station and see Jay Z walking into my studio. "And the winner is 'Ether.'" I had to deliver Jay that blow while he was standing right there
My show? Why?! Flex said my voice was one of authority, and the contest could start at night with his show and could go into the day and end with me in the afternoons when I would announce the winner. The thought made me uncomfortable, but Flex convinced me that with Power looking to capture our audience it was important to remind people that if it happens in hip-hop, it happens here. And he reminded me if we didn't do it, someone else would. So I agreed. Although I didn't know how the vote was going to go, you could feel the Nas wave building
To say he was uncomfortable is an understatement. I couldn't really figure out why he'd agreed to be interviewed in this moment. But evidently he had been under pressure. Like I said, a lot of people felt he had gone too far. Even his mother felt that way. She was the one who suggested that he apologize for getting a woman and a child involved by even mentioning them
