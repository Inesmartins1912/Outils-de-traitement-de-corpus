Yo in the summer time beats bang
Now things are starting to get more drastic
In fights and scuffles you get temporarily scarred with a knife
For them killers sending death threats

Ima cop that jag, and drop that rag
You need to quit, seek a role model to follow
See you? You spend your last buck on weed
Menage a trois, it's on the beach under the stars

I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Even if you feel like you really love her

Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
It's ironic, negative broke to north
