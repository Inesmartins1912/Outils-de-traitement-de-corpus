Oh, looks like another club banger
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Ride the Harley into the sunset

Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
When I walk, my footprints indent cement

And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
