Got her own money 'cause she a go-getter
Your girl don't need any kind of lover (Yeah), be the right kind of lover
Show me, show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

Even though you tried to fuck with my self-esteem
But I'm writing this letter cus
I don't care how your fam or your fake ass friends feel
Through the heat of it all

I like to.. stroll through the park holdin hands
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more
I like to slow dance, I like to romance

Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Keep-keep ya head up)
