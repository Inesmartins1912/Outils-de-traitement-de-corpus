And you know L.A. up in here
In the city of good ol' Watts
California knows how to party
Uh, that's right

This is our Christmas
This is our Christmas
I’ll be the joy in the world that I’ve been searching
This is our Christmas

Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Nigga, that's my shit, don't bite it
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser
Flame up, light it

Call me the specialist, professional"
Keep a toast when you sleep
And if you fold on your peeps
Call me the specialist, professional" (What, y'all want it? Y'all come and get it)
