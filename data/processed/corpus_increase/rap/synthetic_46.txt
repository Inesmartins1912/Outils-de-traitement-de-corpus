Take it straight to playtime, what you need?
And I don't wanna be second on the team
Filling up the space where you should be
Pull up and come see me now

Trips to Venice (Venice), what's the business? (Business)
When she on that pole, and that lets me know
Whatever it is, you can't stop it, 'cause she get low
Woo-ooh (She got it), she got it (She got it)

I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case

When he was around
Around
Me and my mother
Around
