Now he gets on tracks and his roasters them
Anything he drop hot, even if it pop like a pimple
Thoroughest lames would huddle in gangs
I looked, damn an illmatic version of me

You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same, no
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Put kids through school, new titties on wives

Archangel who was born on this earth with no wings
I'll resurrect Jesus myself and buy him a spliff
The Grand Leveler...
Lived inside a ghetto in Hell but got evicted twice

Just wanted to see you naked
They said, "Go to hell," but I told 'em I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna die young
A little Hennessy, it might be good for me
