Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
Brooklyn's in the house
Acceptin' my blessings, rememberin' my lessons

And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back
'Cause I want ya, and I–

Shakira-like and these hips don’t lie
Every moment spent with you
I got the baddest bitch
I ain’t no average bitch

Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
Brooklyn's in the house
Acceptin' my blessings, rememberin' my lessons
