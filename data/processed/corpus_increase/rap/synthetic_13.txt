It feels amazing
That you catch those flights 'cause of feelings
I've been waiting for this night for so long
All the different angles, just a little sample

You can be a leader
And together we can push it up the mountain (Do it)
Get your education
'Cause if I can do it, then you can do it

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die

Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
