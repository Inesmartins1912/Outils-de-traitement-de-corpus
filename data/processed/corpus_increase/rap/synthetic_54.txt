It feels amazing
That you catch those flights 'cause of feelings
I've been waiting for this night for so long
All the different angles, just a little sample

Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
When I walk, my footprints indent cement

I love money, I don't love bitches
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
I was wearing all white, and my hair was looking precious
Ride the Harley into the sunset
