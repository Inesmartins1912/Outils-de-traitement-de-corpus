Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Slow down, don't rush
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
Slow down, don't rush

I like to.. stroll through the park holdin hands
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more
I like to slow dance, I like to romance

I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put seven deadly stains, and hear the blame to crystal conscience

Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Keep-keep ya head up)
