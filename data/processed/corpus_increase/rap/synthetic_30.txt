She got some ass, bring it in
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah
She gimme OPP for my ODB (Yeah), these APC, do your ABCs (Yeah)

You were holding his hand and I'll never be the same, no
But first, slide your panties to the side girl, I'm comin' in
That your boy coulda died right there, no jokin'
Put kids through school, new titties on wives

Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh
Yo, hey yo, uhh

Comet, I vomit up the astronomic on the daily
Big-city rappers, country rappers, greedy rappers
All you hood rappers, misunderstood rappers
I get to wellin on em from the dome
