It's a possibility and probability, on who's gonna execute yo ass
The other half? 'Gon' find crime, money, weed, wine
Night and day and so on, some people are bashful
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns

Oh, looks like another club banger
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
I feel you creepin', I can see it from my shadow
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Even if you feel like you really love her

Exploitations of nations, look at this, it's here, yo
Nobody seen it, whole eons change to zeniths
Brooklyn's in the house
Acceptin' my blessings, rememberin' my lessons
