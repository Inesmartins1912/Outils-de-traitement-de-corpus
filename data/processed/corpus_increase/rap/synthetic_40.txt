Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Slow down, don't rush
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
Slow down, don't rush

It's a possibility and probability, on who's gonna execute yo ass
The other half? 'Gon' find crime, money, weed, wine
Night and day and so on, some people are bashful
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns

We can get illa', In Manila
Jump on a plane, pro'ly jump on a train
Let me take to my land Pampanga
Shine all day, Really shine all night

I walk the block with a halo on a stick, poking your patience
Put the pieces back together my way
All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day
Put seven deadly stains, and hear the blame to crystal conscience
