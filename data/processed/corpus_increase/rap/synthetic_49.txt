Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Down from a huntable surplus to one
Down from a huntable surplus to one
(Down) Down from the huntable surplus to one

Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die

I don't really want no friends
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I don't really want no friends, no
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
