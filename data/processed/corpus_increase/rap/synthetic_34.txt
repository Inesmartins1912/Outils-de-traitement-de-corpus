Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Nigga, that's my shit, don't bite it
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser
Flame up, light it

When he was around
Around
Me and my mother
Around

Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta

Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh
Yo, hey yo, uhh
