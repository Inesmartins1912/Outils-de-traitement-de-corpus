Coco, no Chanel (Woo)
(Go)
Coco Chanel, can you keep your hands to yourself?
You're Coco crazy

But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied
Women steady comin' after me
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Men steady comin' after you

When he was around
Around
Me and my mother
Around

Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
When I walk, my footprints indent cement
