And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back
'Cause I want ya, and Iâ€“

When he was around
Around
Me and my mother
Around

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber

Lovin them rough with pretty faces
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh
Yo, hey yo, uhh
