And even as a crack fiend, Mama
And all the extra love that you gave me
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
There's no way I can pay you back

No more detentions no more "F's"
No more teachers dirty looks
I'll shove you in ya lockers and I'll get in ya face
Four years of high school, I can't believe it's here

I rock shows
Bomb Voltron
Go to jail, don't tell, nigga take that charge
Wit' clips in chrome, spit shit out grown

Or do I see a therapist and numb the pain with the pills?
Yeah
Tune in your speakers and please be my Dr. Whoever, yeah
I think learnin' how to eat pussy from someone who eat pussy
