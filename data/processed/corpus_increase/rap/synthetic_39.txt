Now he gets on tracks and his roasters them
Anything he drop hot, even if it pop like a pimple
Thoroughest lames would huddle in gangs
I looked, damn an illmatic version of me

This is our Christmas
This is our Christmas
I’ll be the joy in the world that I’ve been searching
This is our Christmas

And you know L.A. up in here
In the city of good ol' Watts
California knows how to party
Uh, that's right

It feels amazing
That you catch those flights 'cause of feelings
I've been waiting for this night for so long
All the different angles, just a little sample
