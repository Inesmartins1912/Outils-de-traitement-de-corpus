I don't really want no friends
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I don't really want no friends, no
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya

Leave the party with your daughter (little Debra)
On thin ice, I skate across the lake
Causin' storms in sunny weather, in sunny whether, in sunny weather
La musica de Harry Fraud

Got her own money 'cause she a go-getter
Your girl don't need any kind of lover (Yeah), be the right kind of lover
Show me, show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

We gotta start makin' changes
You gotta operate the easy way
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
Well hey, well that's the way it is
