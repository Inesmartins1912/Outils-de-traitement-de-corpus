Trips to Venice (Venice), what's the business? (Business)
When she on that pole, and that lets me know
Whatever it is, you can't stop it, 'cause she get low
Woo-ooh (She got it), she got it (She got it)

"Represent, represent, represent"
"Blowing up the spot"
Supreme ultimate conductor
A golden aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore the

And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me

I love money, I don't love bitches
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains
