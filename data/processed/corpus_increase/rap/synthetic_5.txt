Keeping me alive
This is what they make you take the medication for
Dude, look, all that noise
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth

Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta

But she started hanging out
She had me sitting low
But I’m a veteran what’s better than a friend
So in love

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber
