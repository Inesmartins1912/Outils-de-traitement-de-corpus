It's a possibility and probability, on who's gonna execute yo ass
The other half? 'Gon' find crime, money, weed, wine
Night and day and so on, some people are bashful
Even the matador don't pull the bull by the horns

I just want you to call my phone
I really wanna make things right
For my own (To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely

Niggas on my dick and on my yack
Bitch niggas always jackin' Blood, but I know they fu
Dropped him, somebody call a fuckin' doctor!
I done dropped my address, y'all know where 6ix9ine at

I rock shows
Bomb Voltron
Go to jail, don't tell, nigga take that charge
Wit' clips in chrome, spit shit out grown
