And since we 'bout to go in a few, go 'head
Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I can go with you
I'll get my things (Yeah), soon as you say (Talk to me)

And you know L.A. up in here
In the city of good ol' Watts
California knows how to party
Uh, that's right

Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
It's ironic, negative broke to north

It's not time yet
On top, make her rock, make her pop
Listen, I'm hungry, I'm amped, I'm ready, I'm souped
Tiffany's bracelet trying to look all pretty
