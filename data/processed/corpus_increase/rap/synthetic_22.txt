It's not time yet
On top, make her rock, make her pop
Listen, I'm hungry, I'm amped, I'm ready, I'm souped
Tiffany's bracelet trying to look all pretty

You might as well stay the hell off the court
Some say I need to stop
Turning cash legal
Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped

And you know L.A. up in here
In the city of good ol' Watts
California knows how to party
Uh, that's right

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
You're the girl, you're the one
Just hold on, we're going home
