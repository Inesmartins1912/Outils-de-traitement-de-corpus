Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
We at the mansion now, tongues touch, caressin' her body (Body)
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Just love makin', nah, baby, we don't fâ€” (None of that)

I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case

And bad bitches who gettin' cake
'Cause we outchea (we outchea)
Uh, money over the best pussy
Lil bro, you know I got you

They ask me what I do and who I do it for (Yeah)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho (True)
We like Snoop and Dre
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches (Two bitches)
