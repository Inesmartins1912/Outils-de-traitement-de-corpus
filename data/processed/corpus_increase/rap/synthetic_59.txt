'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
You're the girl, you're the one
Just hold on, we're going home

I don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino
Shawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed
I just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case

Comet, I vomit up the astronomic on the daily
Big-city rappers, country rappers, greedy rappers
All you hood rappers, misunderstood rappers
I get to wellin on em from the dome

We gotta start makin' changes
You gotta operate the easy way
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
Well hey, well that's the way it is
