Got her own money 'cause she a go-getter
Your girl don't need any kind of lover (Yeah), be the right kind of lover
Show me, show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

I love money, I don't love bitches
Really thought that I was losin' it, now I'm losin'
But now you showed me not to love bitches
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Took a couple loses, yeah

Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
We at the mansion now, tongues touch, caressin' her body (Body)
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Just love makin', nah, baby, we don't fâ€” (None of that)
