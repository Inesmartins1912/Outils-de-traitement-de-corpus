We gotta start makin' changes
You gotta operate the easy way
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
Well hey, well that's the way it is

Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
Nigga, that's my shit, don't bite it
You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser
Flame up, light it

I kept it humble, my stomach grumble, my Rollie tickin'
Due to success I started losin' friends
Jumpin' up out that whip, I let my chain swing (Woo)
I'ma ride for my niggas

Everything look better with a view
We play games of love to avoid the depression
You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
