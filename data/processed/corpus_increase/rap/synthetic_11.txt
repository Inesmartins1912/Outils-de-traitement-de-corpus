I'm twenty-four with twenty-four figures, twenty-four triggers
Call the doctor 'cause my wrist game sick, mane
Blue, white, yellow, black (Black), pink diamonds (Diamonds)
Matter fact, put yourself in my shoes (Yeah)

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber

Got her own money 'cause she a go-getter
Your girl don't need any kind of lover (Yeah), be the right kind of lover
Show me, show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider

Under paid need to check in the mail every twenty days
Long it took before perfecting my style
Only listen to rap if the jewels ain't mentioned
I got it hemmed, When I...When I...attack
