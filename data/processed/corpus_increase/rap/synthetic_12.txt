Streets not safe but I never run away
I pray, I pray
Back up, back up, and whine it
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, andâ€“)

But I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied
Women steady comin' after me
'Cause we gon' fight, oh, yes, we gon' fight (We gon' fight)
Men steady comin' after you

It feels amazing
That you catch those flights 'cause of feelings
I've been waiting for this night for so long
All the different angles, just a little sample

She got some ass, bring it in
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah
She gimme OPP for my ODB (Yeah), these APC, do your ABCs (Yeah)
