We gotta start makin' changes
You gotta operate the easy way
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
Well hey, well that's the way it is

Even look good with them clothes on, it's so on, lil' mama so grown
Here you fuckin' with the right guy
She drop it low, make me wanna throw some D's on it (Hey)
Young boss baby, I treat you, treat you to the finer things

You might as well stay the hell off the court
Some say I need to stop
Turning cash legal
Any affair I'm at my peers is strapped

Push a button on these broke boys (Skrrt), that's detonation
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah, skrrt)
Give me a pistol, then run with the K's
