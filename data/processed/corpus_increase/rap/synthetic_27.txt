This is our Christmas
This is our Christmas
I’ll be the joy in the world that I’ve been searching
This is our Christmas

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim

Rock a show hard as an army of Viking warriors
The image and the style that you're used to

Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
We at the mansion now, tongues touch, caressin' her body (Body)
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Just love makin', nah, baby, we don't f— (None of that)
