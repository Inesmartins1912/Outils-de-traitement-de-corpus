And bad bitches who gettin' cake
'Cause we outchea (we outchea)
Uh, money over the best pussy
Lil bro, you know I got you

Under paid need to check in the mail every twenty days
Long it took before perfecting my style
Only listen to rap if the jewels ain't mentioned
I got it hemmed, When I...When I...attack

Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Took a couple loses, yeah

Got her own money 'cause she a go-getter
Your girl don't need any kind of lover (Yeah), be the right kind of lover
Show me, show me
If you show me your ambitions of a rider
