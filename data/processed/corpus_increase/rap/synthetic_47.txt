And since we 'bout to go in a few, go 'head
Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I can go with you
I'll get my things (Yeah), soon as you say (Talk to me)

It's not time yet
On top, make her rock, make her pop
Listen, I'm hungry, I'm amped, I'm ready, I'm souped
Tiffany's bracelet trying to look all pretty

Yo in the summer time beats bang
Now things are starting to get more drastic
In fights and scuffles you get temporarily scarred with a knife
For them killers sending death threats

We can get illa', In Manila
Jump on a plane, pro'ly jump on a train
Let me take to my land Pampanga
Shine all day, Really shine all night
