It's not time yet
On top, make her rock, make her pop
Listen, I'm hungry, I'm amped, I'm ready, I'm souped
Tiffany's bracelet trying to look all pretty

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber

They ask me what I do and who I do it for (Yeah)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho (True)
We like Snoop and Dre
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches (Two bitches)

Comet, I vomit up the astronomic on the daily
Big-city rappers, country rappers, greedy rappers
All you hood rappers, misunderstood rappers
I get to wellin on em from the dome
