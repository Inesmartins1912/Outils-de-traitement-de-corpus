And I know when that hotline bling
I know when that hotline bling
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone

Under paid need to check in the mail every twenty days
Long it took before perfecting my style
Only listen to rap if the jewels ain't mentioned
I got it hemmed, When I...When I...attack

Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Slow down, don't rush
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
Slow down, don't rush

Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
When I walk, my footprints indent cement
