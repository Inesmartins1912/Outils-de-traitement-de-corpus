Stories of us painted on the walls of caves
Iâ€™m white as wife beaters on white trash on cop shows
Rock a show hard as an army of Viking warriors
The image and the style that you're used to

Trips to Venice (Venice), what's the business? (Business)
When she on that pole, and that lets me know
Whatever it is, you can't stop it, 'cause she get low
Woo-ooh (She got it), she got it (She got it)

Archangel who was born on this earth with no wings
I'll resurrect Jesus myself and buy him a spliff
The Grand Leveler...
Lived inside a ghetto in Hell but got evicted twice

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
