I like to.. stroll through the park holdin hands
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it
(Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more
I like to slow dance, I like to romance

I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
One life to live, so here we go
Uh

And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead
Sword swing in the temple, mental state, danger chamber

I don't really want no friends
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I don't really want no friends, no
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
