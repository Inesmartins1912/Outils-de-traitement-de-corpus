I'm sorry that it took so long to see
To apologize for things that I've done
Her daddy should have never let her out that young
Is affecting the people around me

Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Keep-keep ya head up)

Even look good with them clothes on, it's so on, lil' mama so grown
Here you fuckin' with the right guy
She drop it low, make me wanna throw some D's on it (Hey)
Young boss baby, I treat you, treat you to the finer things

They feelings come and go like when they weave in
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
