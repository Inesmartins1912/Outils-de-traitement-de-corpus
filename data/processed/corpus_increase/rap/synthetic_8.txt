Push a button on these broke boys (Skrrt), that's detonation
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I woke up in a new Bugatti (Woah, skrrt)
Give me a pistol, then run with the K's

Trips to Venice (Venice), what's the business? (Business)
When she on that pole, and that lets me know
Whatever it is, you can't stop it, 'cause she get low
Woo-ooh (She got it), she got it (She got it)

And since we 'bout to go in a few, go 'head
Employed with the block since around '94, boy
And if I can go with you
I'll get my things (Yeah), soon as you say (Talk to me)

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
To apologize for things that I've done
Her daddy should have never let her out that young
Is affecting the people around me
