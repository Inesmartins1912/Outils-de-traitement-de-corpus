If you ain't got this then you incomplete
With the mic in my hand swinging to a beat
Get out your seats and let's get ill
I'm a grown ass man who gots to survive

They ask me what I do and who I do it for (Yeah)
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho (True)
We like Snoop and Dre
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches (Two bitches)

Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Took a couple loses, yeah

Call me the specialist, professional"
Keep a toast when you sleep
And if you fold on your peeps
Call me the specialist, professional" (What, y'all want it? Y'all come and get it)
