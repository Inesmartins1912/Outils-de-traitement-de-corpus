Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
It's ironic, negative broke to north

Even though it's for the money B, I'm droppin' knowledge G
Slow down, don't rush
Yeah, I pledge allegiance to it non-stop
Slow down, don't rush

If your here by my side
What you like what you hate
I might not give you back
Might not give you back

Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
We at the mansion now, tongues touch, caressin' her body (Body)
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Just love makin', nah, baby, we don't fâ€” (None of that)
