I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

She says I am the one, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side

And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
It's absolute, yeah (Yeah), I'm back, reboot (It's lit)
Wet like I'm Lizzie
