Shoo-ca-choo-ca!
It was your doom, Annie (Doggone it)
Ow!
Ow!

Don't want you on my mind
I finally found what went wrong
Now it's time for you to taste the bitter end
You think I would mind

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
My level's too high to (Happy), bring me down
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth

'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah
