I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love...
Baby, it was uncool to love me

And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?

Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)

I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love...
Baby, it was uncool to love me
