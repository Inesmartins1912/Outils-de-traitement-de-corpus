Ooh, I could hate you now
We didn't give a fuck back then
I broke your heart last week
If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'

And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?

Ooh
'Round and around and around and around, we go
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
I want you to stay

I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
A moment in time, don't watch me cry
I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
A moment in time, don't watch me cry
