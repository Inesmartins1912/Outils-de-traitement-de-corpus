Lick your lips as I soap my feet
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
You say, "When we married", 'cause you're not bitter
I'm in the tub, you on the seat

Freedom
Who cares what they see?
'Cause you still believe
Freedom

If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
(You ready)
Or would it be so beautiful?
Who's it gonna be?

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
