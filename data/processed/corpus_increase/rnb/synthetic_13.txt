I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
A moment in time, don't watch me cry
I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
A moment in time, don't watch me cry

I've been waiting so long for a love like this
(We got London on da Track)
I do not play about mine
Bend over backwards, acrobats for ya, yeah

Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
(Dos) Wait a second
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper

No one, no one, no one
When the rain is pouring down
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Through the days and nights
