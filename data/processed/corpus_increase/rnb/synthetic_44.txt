She says I am the one, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side

But don't forget to come and pick up your feelings
So now I'm savin' me
Don't forget (Don't forget) to come and pick up your, oh, feelings (Oh, pick up your feelings)
New phone (Who is this?)

You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
You a bully or a lover?
Work got me in and out of state
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more and more and more and more and more)

I finally got you out my bed
And you don't know what love is
And I need you to know
If you don't put up a fight
