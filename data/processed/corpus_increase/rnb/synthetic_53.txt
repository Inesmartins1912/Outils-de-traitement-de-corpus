I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Talk about where we're goin'
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And something evil's lurking in the dark

And find a way to bring me to you
Yeah (Seeing it eye to eye)
If you're ever lonely, stop
(For the first time ever, we're eye to eye)

You got to be startin' somethin'
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
