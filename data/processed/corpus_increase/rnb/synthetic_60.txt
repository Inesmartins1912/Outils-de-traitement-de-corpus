I'ma make it by any means (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
Even if it ain't all it seems (Come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)

Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)

Lick your lips as I soap my feet
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
You say, "When we married", 'cause you're not bitter
I'm in the tub, you on the seat

Donâ€™t go throw me under the bus
You want this (You want this)
You want this (You want this)
Be honest
