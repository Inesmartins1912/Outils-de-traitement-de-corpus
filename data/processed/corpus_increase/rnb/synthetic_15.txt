("Okay, alright, alright, alright")
The government don't wanna see
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
"All I want to say is that

I, I, I know you got someone comin'
And our time was right
Keep a place for me
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
It's the only way we know how to rock
It's the only way we know how to rock

You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
You a bully or a lover?
Work got me in and out of state
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more and more and more and more and more)
