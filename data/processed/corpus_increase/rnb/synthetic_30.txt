Can we burn something, babe?
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
Got me like, ow
And I can't get enough

Your body rock and your booty poppin', I'm proud to call you my bitch

And thought I didn't love you when I did (When I did)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (To yourself)
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (Dick to me)

I feel I lost a piece of mine
And I wish that time never mattered
I wish that time
