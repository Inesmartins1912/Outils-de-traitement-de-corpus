Lick your lips as I soap my feet
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
You say, "When we married", 'cause you're not bitter
I'm in the tub, you on the seat

You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
You a bully or a lover?
Work got me in and out of state
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more and more and more and more and more)

Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own
Lil' baby in her bag, in her Birkin (Ayy)
I don't even wanna go back home

I might be on his mind
Remember on the weekend
Don't you worry 'bout my ex
Eat, pray, love, grow
