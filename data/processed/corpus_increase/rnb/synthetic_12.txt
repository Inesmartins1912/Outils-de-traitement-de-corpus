And sit right next to you, you
I want you around (Around)
Feel you
Feel you

I didn't wanna get her involved
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
That soft pink matter

All I hear is...
Nothing feels better
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
I admit

How it feels to love a girl
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
