Some people want it all
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If it ain't you, baby
Mm-mm

I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Talk about where we're goin'
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

And thought I didn't love you when I did (When I did)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (To yourself)
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (Dick to me)
What kind of fuckery is this?

Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget
Don't forget, your peace lives within
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Butterfly, lost in the night
