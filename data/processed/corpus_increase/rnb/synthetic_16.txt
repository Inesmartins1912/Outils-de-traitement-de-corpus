'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah

I'm a fool for you
It's somethin' about you that's so familiar
Maybe it was me who brought you here
I'm a fool for you

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And something evil's lurking in the dark

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
