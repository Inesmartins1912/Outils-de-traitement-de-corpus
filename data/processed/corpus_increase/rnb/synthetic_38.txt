Won't you say my, say my
Pick up the phone when you alone
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Sailingâ€…overseas and just

But simply 'cause I love it
Yeah, hey
Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
That's why I'm pacin' back and forth

I can see your halo, halo, halo, ooh
Baby, I can feel your halo
Gravity can't begin
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

We can not help who we're attracted to
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
She's everything I want (Everything I want), and it's crystal clear
This energy (Oh the energy), like I'm 'bout to win (I'm 'bout to win)
