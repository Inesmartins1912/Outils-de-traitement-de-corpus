Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
It's the only way we know how to rock
It's the only way we know how to rock

Know that you are loved
Know that you are loved
Even if you don't love yourself
Know that you are loved

Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know

Some people want it all
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If it ain't you, baby
Mm-mm
