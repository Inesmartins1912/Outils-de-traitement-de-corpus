Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Believe or trust in anything that you say

I'ma make it by any means (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
Even if it ain't all it seems (Come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)

And I don't even know what for (Nah, ah-ah)
Wondering what I did to lose you (What I did to lose you)
Ooh
Yeah, they be winnin' (Why they be? Why they be?)

And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?
