Like these two bitches that might be related
I don't do no old hoes (Oh, no, no)
At the night show (Higher)
Everything can happen at the night show

And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
It's absolute, yeah (Yeah), I'm back, reboot (It's lit)
Wet like I'm Lizzie

I might be on his mind
Remember on the weekend
Don't you worry 'bout my ex
Eat, pray, love, grow

Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
I don't know how we end up in the red
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
