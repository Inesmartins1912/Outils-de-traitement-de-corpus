It's my responsibility
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
We could've never had it all
And no emotional debts

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And something evil's lurking in the dark

We sex again in the mornin'
Daddy, I want you right now
Sleep tight
Love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)

I'm a fool for you
It's somethin' about you that's so familiar
Maybe it was me who brought you here
I'm a fool for you
