Yeah, hey
Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
That's why I'm pacin' back and forth

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
(Dos) Wait a second
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper

Need some distance from you
Love is not our enemy
(Oh-oh-oh)
Need some distance from you
