Ooh, I could hate you now
We didn't give a fuck back then
I broke your heart last week
If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'

Some people want it all
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If it ain't you, baby
Mm-mm

We can not help who we're attracted to
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
She's everything I want (Everything I want), and it's crystal clear
This energy (Oh the energy), like I'm 'bout to win (I'm 'bout to win)

I, I, I know you got someone comin'
And our time was right
Keep a place for me
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
