Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget)
Do ya, do ya?
That's why I kissed you
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh

How it feels to love a girl
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget
Don't forget, your peace lives within
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Butterfly, lost in the night

I, I, I'll spit on it, it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, woah-woah
Why I should move
Take this water and hydrate, bitch
