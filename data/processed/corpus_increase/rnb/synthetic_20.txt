But don't be actin' like I need you
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia

I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love...
Baby, it was uncool to love me

I get those goosebumps every time
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Oh, back the fuck up off me (Brr, brr, brr)

I, I, I'll spit on it, it (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, woah-woah
Why I should move
Take this water and hydrate, bitch
