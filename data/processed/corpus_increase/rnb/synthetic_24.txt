Take that, rewind it back
Yeah, yeah
Okay (Okay)
And Lil Jon

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know

Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
It's the only way we know how to rock
It's the only way we know how to rock
