I might be on his mind
Remember on the weekend
Don't you worry 'bout my ex
Eat, pray, love, grow

Donâ€™t go throw me under the bus
You want this (You want this)
You want this (You want this)
Be honest

Shoo-ca-choo-ca!
It was your doom, Annie (Doggone it)
Ow!
Ow!

Tonight, I'm showin' up to shine
We celebratin' and it feels so good (Yeah)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright, yeah, yeah)
And I like where I'm goin'
