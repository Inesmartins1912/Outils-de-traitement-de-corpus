He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop molly
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django (If we)
He don't know me but he settin' up to blow me, uh
I might sound crazy (Oh)

You wanna know how hold on the low
Helps my body to unwind
You wanna know how hold on the low
Will you listen? Ever lie to me?

My body is sayin'
(What I really hope and pray is can we get it together?)
My body is sayin'
We got London on da Track

Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own
Lil' baby in her bag, in her Birkin (Ayy)
I don't even wanna go back home
