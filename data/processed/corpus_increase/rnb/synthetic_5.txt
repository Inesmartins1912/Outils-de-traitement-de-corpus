Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
It's the only way we know how to rock
It's the only way we know how to rock

I didn't wanna get her involved
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
That soft pink matter

Need some distance from you
Love is not our enemy
(Oh-oh-oh)
Need some distance from you

I, I'm ready, yes, I am
I'm ready (You know I'm ready) to love you (To love) forever, baby (Forever)
Hey love...
Baby, it was uncool to love me
