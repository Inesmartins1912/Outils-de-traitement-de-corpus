Ride on through the middle of the night
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah
Good Lord, you’re fucking beautiful (so beautiful)

We can not help who we're attracted to
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
She's everything I want (Everything I want), and it's crystal clear
This energy (Oh the energy), like I'm 'bout to win (I'm 'bout to win)

Hope you're doin' well, bruh
That's every day shit
That kumbaya shit
That kumbaya shit

Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget
Don't forget, your peace lives within
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Butterfly, lost in the night
