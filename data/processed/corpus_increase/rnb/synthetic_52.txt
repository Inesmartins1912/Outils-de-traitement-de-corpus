Only you, only you can understand why
So why do I? (Why do I?)
Sometimes, your world spins 'round
So fix your tone, man, you're stronger than that

Some people want it all
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If it ain't you, baby
Mm-mm

Only you, only you can understand why
So why do I? (Why do I?)
Sometimes, your world spins 'round
So fix your tone, man, you're stronger than that

Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
