'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah

The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)

But don't be actin' like I need you
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia

You wanna know how hold on the low
Helps my body to unwind
You wanna know how hold on the low
Willâ€…you listen? Ever lie to me?
