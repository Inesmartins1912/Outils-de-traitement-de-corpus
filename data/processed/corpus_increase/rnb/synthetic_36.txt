Can we talk for a minute?
One more chance with you again
I'll know just what to say
How I just could not get it right, oh

I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Talk about where we're goin'
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Talk about where we're goin'
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

Freedom
Who cares what they see?
'Cause you still believe
Freedom
