Only you, only you can understand why
So why do I? (Why do I?)
Sometimes, your world spins 'round
So fix your tone, man, you're stronger than that

At all, at all
So why do I care, I care at all
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up

("Okay, alright, alright, alright")
The government don't wanna see
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
"All I want to say is that

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And something evil's lurking in the dark
