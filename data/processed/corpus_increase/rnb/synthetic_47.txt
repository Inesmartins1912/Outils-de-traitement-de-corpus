'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah

Ooh
'Round and around and around and around, we go
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
I want you to stay

All I hear is...
Nothing feels better
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
I admit

Is it gonna be me and you?
Did you really mean the words that you said (Did you really mean what you said?), said?
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
Is it gonna be me and you?
