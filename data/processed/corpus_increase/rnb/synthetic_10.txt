Need some distance from you
Love is not our enemy
(Oh-oh-oh)
Need some distance from you

Ooh
'Round and around and around and around, we go
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
I want you to stay

Can we burn something, babe?
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
Got me like, ow
And I can't get enough

But don't be actin' like I need you
I'm a bougie ass nigga, left the roof at home
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia
