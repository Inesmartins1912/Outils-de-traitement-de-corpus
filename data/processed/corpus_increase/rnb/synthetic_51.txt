Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
When you ah guh learn, learn, learn, learn, learn, learn?
I haffi work, work, work, work, work, work
I mean, who am I to hold your past against you?

I didn't wanna get her involved
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
That soft pink matter

I get those goosebumps every time
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy)
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Oh, back the fuck up off me (Brr, brr, brr)

But that just ain't up for sale
See, they want to buy my pride
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
See, all of my kindness (Mhm)
