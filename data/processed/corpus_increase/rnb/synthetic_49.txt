All I hear is...
Nothing feels better
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
I admit

Young, dumb
Yadadadadadadada
I'm pretty sure I'm right
Just like I know you should

He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop molly
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django (If we)
He don't know me but he settin' up to blow me, uh
I might sound crazy (Oh)

But I'm glad you see what happens when
After I saw you laying next to her
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain, ooh
Why am I the one who's still crying? Huh
