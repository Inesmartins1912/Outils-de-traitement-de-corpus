But simply 'cause I love it
Yeah, hey
Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
That's why I'm pacin' back and forth

Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own
Lil' baby in her bag, in her Birkin (Ayy)
I don't even wanna go back home

Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
(Dos) Wait a second
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper

Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls need love, too
I wanna be your healing
