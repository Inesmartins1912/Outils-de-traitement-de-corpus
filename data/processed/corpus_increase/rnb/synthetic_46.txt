And find a way to bring me to you
Yeah (Seeing it eye to eye)
If you're ever lonely, stop
(For the first time ever, we're eye to eye)

Take that, rewind it back
Yeah, yeah
Okay (Okay)
And Lil Jon

Young, dumb
Yadadadadadadada
I'm pretty sure I'm right
Just like I know you should

I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)
