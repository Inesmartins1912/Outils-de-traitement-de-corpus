The song I sing
Where have you been?
Wild but yet divine
You captured this heart of mine

Take that, rewind it back
Yeah, yeah
Okay (Okay)
And Lil Jon

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

But that just ain't up for sale
See, they want to buy my pride
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
See, all of my kindness (Mhm)
