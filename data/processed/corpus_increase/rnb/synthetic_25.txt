And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?

So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Ay, ay, ay)
Boy, you're losing your mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Obsessed)
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Will the real MC please)

I like cornbreads and collard greens, bitch
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
Girl, I hear some thunder
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh

Tonight, I'm showin' up to shine
We celebratin' and it feels so good (Yeah)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright, yeah, yeah)
And I like where I'm goin'
