I like cornbreads and collard greens, bitch
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
Girl, I hear some thunder
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh

Baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you
Even though we're goin' through it
Even though we're goin' through it

I'm a fool for you
It's somethin' about you that's so familiar
Maybe it was me who brought you here
I'm a fool for you

The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
