He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop molly
I got these niggas whipped, call me Django (If we)
He don't know me but he settin' up to blow me, uh
I might sound crazy (Oh)

Baby girl, you got it, girl, you got it, girl (Oh-oh)
Hopefully, I don't leave you on your own
Lil' baby in her bag, in her Birkin (Ayy)
I don't even wanna go back home

Donâ€™t go throw me under the bus
You want this (You want this)
You want this (You want this)
Be honest

You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from
Run when you hear the sirens comin' (Ah, ah)
(I wanna turn those blue lights) What have you done?
