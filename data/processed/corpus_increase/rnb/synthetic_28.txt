I, I, I know you got someone comin'
And our time was right
Keep a place for me
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night

And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And something evil's lurking in the dark

I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)
