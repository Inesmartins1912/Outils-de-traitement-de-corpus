I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)

But don't forget to come and pick up your feelings
So now I'm savin' me
Don't forget (Don't forget) to come and pick up your, oh, feelings (Oh, pick up your feelings)
New phone (Who is this?)

I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
A moment in time, don't watch me cry
I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
A moment in time, don't watch me cry

But I'm glad you see what happens when
After I saw you laying next to her
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain, ooh
Why am I the one who's still crying? Huh
