And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Yonc√© all on his mouth like liquor
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash
Are you happy to be in Paris?

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Focus on communicating
Send me your location, let's
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Focus on communicating
Send me your location, let's
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm

Need some distance from you
Love is not our enemy
(Oh-oh-oh)
Need some distance from you
