I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go
I said, "I got no idea"

Get on without my guy
I died a hundred times
Black, black, black, black
We only said goodbye with words

You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
You a bully or a lover?
Work got me in and out of state
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more and more and more and more and more)

It's my responsibility
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
We could've never had it all
And no emotional debts
