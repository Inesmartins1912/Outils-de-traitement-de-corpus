I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)

Don't want you on my mind
I finally found what went wrong
Now it's time for you to taste the bitter end
You think I would mind

Can we burn something, babe?
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
Got me like, ow
And I can't get enough

I might be on his mind
Remember on the weekend
Don't you worry 'bout my ex
Eat, pray, love, grow
