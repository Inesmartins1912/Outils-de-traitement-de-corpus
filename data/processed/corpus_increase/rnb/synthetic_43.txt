'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah

The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)

Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
It's the only way we know how to rock
It's the only way we know how to rock

I finally got you out my bed
And you don't know what love is
And I need you to know
If you don't put up a fight
