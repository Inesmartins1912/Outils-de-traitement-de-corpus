Hope you're doin' well, bruh
That's every day shit
That kumbaya shit
That kumbaya shit

I like cornbreads and collard greens, bitch
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
Girl, I hear some thunder
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh

And I don't even know what for (Nah, ah-ah)
Wondering what I did to lose you (What I did to lose you)
Ooh
Yeah, they be winnin' (Why they be? Why they be?)

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you
