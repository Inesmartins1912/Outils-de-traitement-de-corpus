'Cause we belong together
The pain reflected in this song
Come back, baby, please
Sweet love, yeah

You my nigga not my master, I'll escape thinking who can I run to?
You a bully or a lover?
Work got me in and out of state
When I did all I could do, but you be wanting more (but you be wanting more and more and more and more and more and more)

I can see your halo, halo, halo, ooh
Baby, I can feel your halo
Gravity can't begin
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

No one, no one, no one
When the rain is pouring down
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Through the days and nights
