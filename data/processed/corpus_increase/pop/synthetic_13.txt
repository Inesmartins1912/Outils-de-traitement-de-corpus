(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
If he's holdin' onto you so tight

We gotta get away from here
Your bullets, your bullets?
Why are we always stuck and running from
We never learn, we've been here before

Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Commas, commas in my head, man
Like they OT

And ones that got away
And goin' way too far
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Like tattoos and regrets, words I never meant
