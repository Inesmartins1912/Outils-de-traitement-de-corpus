Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber

I swear on my life, I always try
When I mutter in my sleep
So I fall more behind every week
I say, "Shut up â€™fore she sees," another motherfuckin' trap

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it

I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
