They hated on me since school, yeah
Just wait until the summer when they let me out the house, bitch
Made a million at Sue's, yeah
They even post it on blogs overseas

It's about damn time (Time)
I'm comin' out tonight, I'm comin' out tonight (Uh-huh)
Okay (Okay), alright
Okay (Okay), alright

This dancing was killing me softly
Like it was easy
And I let it burn
To love, love, yeah

If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
