The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
The only time I'd ever call you mine

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
Don't you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why

Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
I won't, I won't, I...
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, nah
Ain't no crying in the club

I'm not where you left me at all, so
Up, up
Up, up
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
