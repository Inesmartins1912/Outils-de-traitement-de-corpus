I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Once in twenty lifetimes, I
Vintage tee, brand new phone
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
You put me on and said I was your favorite

You look happy and healthy, not me
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it

You said she's scared of me?
I'll be your animal
I mean, I don't see what she sees
I'm a bad guy
