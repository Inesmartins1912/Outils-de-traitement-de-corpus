If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

Oh, na-na-na (No, no, no, take me back)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Hey)
She waited on me (And what?)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)

And there we are again when nobody had to know
I still remember the first fall of snow
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
I remember it all too well

Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber
