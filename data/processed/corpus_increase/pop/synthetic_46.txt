You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone

Can we both say the words and forget this?
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it
