I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"

But I've read this one where you come undone
You left your typewriter at my apartment
But you awaken with dread
Who's gonna hold you?

It's about damn time (Time)
I'm comin' out tonight, I'm comin' out tonight (Uh-huh)
Okay (Okay), alright
Okay (Okay), alright
