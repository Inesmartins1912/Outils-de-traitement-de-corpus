In this world, it's just us
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
When everything gets in the way
You know it's not the same

(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
If he's holdin' onto you so tight

You look happy and healthy, not me
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it

This dancing was killing me softly
Like it was easy
And I let it burn
To love, love, yeah
