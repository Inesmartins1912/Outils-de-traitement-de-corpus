You're singin' it together
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

God, I'm so blue, know we're through
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
If he's holdin' onto you so tight

Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber
