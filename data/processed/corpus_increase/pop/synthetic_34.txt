I can't feel my face when I'm with you
Uh
When we're deep in love
But I love it

I may be crazy, don't mind me
Well, I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
And last night, you were in my room

The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
The only time I'd ever call you mine

I've been here all night (Been here all night, baby)
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle (Been here all day, baby; Ayy)
Gun pop, then I make my gum pop
