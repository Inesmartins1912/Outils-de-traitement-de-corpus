I'm like chardonnay (Okay), get better over time (So you know)
Somebody come get this man
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?

In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
'Cause he don't love you anymore
Listen, if he don't love you anymore
If you need advice, let me simplify

You're incriminating, no disguise
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way

I got everything I wanted
But I don't wanna let anybody know
I got everything I wanted
Toâ€…anyone who might care
