The music's got me going
Then you say
I wanna dance
I wanna dance

You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone

I'll stop time for you
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Oh, na-na-na (No, no, no, take me back)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Hey)
She waited on me (And what?)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
