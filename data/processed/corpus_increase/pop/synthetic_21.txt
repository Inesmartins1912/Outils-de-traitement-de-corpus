But I know that I'll make it out alive
And now that I'm without your kisses
And now that I'm without your kisses
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (Wind up dead)

Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I want your belly and that summer feelin'

I got everything I wanted
But I don't wanna let anybody know
I got everything I wanted
Toâ€…anyone who might care

Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
I won't, I won't, I...
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, nah
Ain't no crying in the club
