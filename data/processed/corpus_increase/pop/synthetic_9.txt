You said, "Stop playin' it safe
You're in my head (I blame)
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

But I know that I'll make it out alive
And now that I'm without your kisses
And now that I'm without your kisses
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (Wind up dead)

For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'
For ya
Coming for ya (Coming for you)

You're singin' it together
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
