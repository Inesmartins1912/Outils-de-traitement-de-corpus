Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Side bitch outta your league too, ah

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it

You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
I need you more than I want to
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)
