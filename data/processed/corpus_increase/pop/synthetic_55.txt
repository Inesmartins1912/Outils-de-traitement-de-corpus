You can hit while they watch, boy
'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said
Boy, you're the one, you're the only man
They all wanna know how you get to me

They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that?)

Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
Take my wallet if you want it now
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Everything 24 karats

One's already on his second wife
One friend left to sell clothes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
