Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

And there we are again when nobody had to know
I still remember the first fall of snow
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
I remember it all too well

You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
I'm happier than ever
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
And I'd end up more afraid
