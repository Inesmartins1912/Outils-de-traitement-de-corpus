People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (Uh, uh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But I know I had to have it, yeah

Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
Even when I'm crying crazy
No, you ain't from the start

Sorry I'm so clingy, I don't mean to be a lot
Warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me (Me, me, me, me, me)
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh, is it warm enough

'Cause they sayin' we already did it
You got a fetish for my love
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
