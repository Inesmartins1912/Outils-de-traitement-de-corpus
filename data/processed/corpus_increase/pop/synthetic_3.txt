And you won't find no one that's better
(Die for you)
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you

Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
I won't, I won't, I...
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, nah
Ain't no crying in the club

Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber

Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (Yeah)
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Long as we got
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk (Ooh, no, I won't)
