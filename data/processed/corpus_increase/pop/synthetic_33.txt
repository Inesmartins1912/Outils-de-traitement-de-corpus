I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

And you won't find no one that's better
(Die for you)
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you

And ones that got away
And goin' way too far
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Like tattoos and regrets, words I never meant

And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
Forgetâ€…what I said
