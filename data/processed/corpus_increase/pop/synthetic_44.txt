You can hit while they watch, boy
'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said
Boy, you're the one, you're the only man
They all wanna know how you get to me

Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step, right, left to my beat
Side step, right, left to my beat
That can sweep you up like a robber

And I won't ever let you go
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Lovin' can hurt
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed

날리는 눈이 나라면
이 순간 흐르는 시간조차 미워
또 몇 밤을 더 새워야
니가 변한 건지 (니가 변한 건지)
