You said she's scared of me?
I'll be your animal
I mean, I don't see what she sees
I'm a bad guy

You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
I'm levitating

If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (Yeah)
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Long as we got
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk (Ooh, no, I won't)
