If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
Let's set this party off right
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket (Keep up)

Ah-ah, to get to you
I've been cryin' with the wolves
Ah-ah, to get to you
Blindly, I am following

And there we are again when nobody had to know
I still remember the first fall of snow
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
I remember it all too well
