Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (Yeah)
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Long as we got
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk (Ooh, no, I won't)

You're singin' it together
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it

Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah)
