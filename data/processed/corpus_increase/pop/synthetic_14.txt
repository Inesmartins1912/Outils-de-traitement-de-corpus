It's about damn time (Time)
I'm comin' out tonight, I'm comin' out tonight (Uh-huh)
Okay (Okay), alright
Okay (Okay), alright

Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
Take my wallet if you want it now
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Everything 24 karats

(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
If he's holdin' onto you so tight

I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em (Baby, you know I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
