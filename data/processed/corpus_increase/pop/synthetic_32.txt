Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
You can't tame me, can't tame me
If you don't like the way I talk

God, I'm so blue, know we're through
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

Paint my nails cherry-red
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Match the roses that you left
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

We don't have it anymore
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
