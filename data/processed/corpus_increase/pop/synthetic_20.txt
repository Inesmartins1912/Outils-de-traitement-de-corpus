There's no place I'd rather be in this world
So just turn down the lights
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more
Above us all the stars are watchin'

I may be crazy, don't mind me
Well, I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
And last night, you were in my room

Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
Take my wallet if you want it now
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Everything 24 karats

Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah)
