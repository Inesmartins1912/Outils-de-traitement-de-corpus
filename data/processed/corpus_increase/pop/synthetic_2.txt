Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
Even when I'm crying crazy
No, you ain't from the start

There's no place I'd rather be in this world
So just turn down the lights
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more
Above us all the stars are watchin'

But I just want you to know
I was wrong
Do all the things I should've done
When I had the chance

I've been here all night (Been here all night, baby)
And, boy, got me walkin' side to side (Side to side)
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle (Been here all day, baby; Ayy)
Gun pop, then I make my gum pop
