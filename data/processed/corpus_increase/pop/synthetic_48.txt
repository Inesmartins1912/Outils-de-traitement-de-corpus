But I've read this one where you come undone
You left your typewriter at my apartment
But you awaken with dread
Who's gonna hold you?

Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
I got homies, let it go, oh
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload

'Cause they sayin' we already did it
You got a fetish for my love
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it
