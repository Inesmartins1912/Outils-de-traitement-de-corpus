So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh
(This is ah) 'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along
King Kong, kick the drum

And I won't ever let you go
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Lovin' can hurt
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
I'm happier than ever
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
And I'd end up more afraid

Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
I won't, I won't, I...
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, nah
Ain't no crying in the club
