I can't feel my face when I'm with you
Uh
When we're deep in love
But I love it

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah)

And I won't ever let you go
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Lovin' can hurt
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
