I'm like chardonnay (Okay), get better over time (So you know)
Somebody come get this man
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
I think he wanna be way more than friends, what?

She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

This dancing was killing me softly
Like it was easy
And I let it burn
To love, love, yeah

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it
