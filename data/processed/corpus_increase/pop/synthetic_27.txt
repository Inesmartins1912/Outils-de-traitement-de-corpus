Does it ever?
Just take her home and you'll feel better
I need somebody now (Ooh-ooh)
I'm crawlin' in my skin

But I know that I'll make it out alive
And now that I'm without your kisses
And now that I'm without your kisses
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (Wind up dead)

Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Commas, commas in my head, man
Like they OT

In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
'Cause he don't love you anymore
Listen, if he don't love you anymore
If you need advice, let me simplify
