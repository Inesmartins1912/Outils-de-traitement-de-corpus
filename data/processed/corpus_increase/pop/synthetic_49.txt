No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
I need you more than I want to
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
'Cause he don't love you anymore
Listen, if he don't love you anymore
If you need advice, let me simplify

(Yeah) And I can be all the things you told me not to be
You love it how I touch you, my one
Oh yeah (God is a woman, yeah)
It's all in me (Ooh)

We gotta get away from here
Your bullets, your bullets?
Why are we always stuck and running from
We never learn, we've been here before
