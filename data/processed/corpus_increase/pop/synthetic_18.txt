And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
Hoping that you'll understand
Maybe we found love right where we are
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy

The music's got me going
Then you say
I wanna dance
I wanna dance

Good days, good days, always
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
Feelin' like Jericho

And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
I like it, I like it
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (Oh)
I'm pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Yeah, ayy)
