I can't feel my face when I'm with you
Uh
When we're deep in love
But I love it

And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
Forgetâ€…what I said

Good days, good days, always
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
Feelin' like Jericho

Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
