You just want attention, you don't want my heart
What are you doin', huh? (Yeah, you just want attention)
What are you doin' to me? (I knew from the start)
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin', love?)

'Cause they sayin' we already did it
You got a fetish for my love
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
So I cut you off
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
I've been done

The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
The only time I'd ever call you mine
