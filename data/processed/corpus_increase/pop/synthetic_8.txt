Ah-ah, to get to you
I've been cryin' with the wolves
Ah-ah, to get to you
Blindly, I am following

Why you bother me when you know you got a woman? (Yeah)
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Long as we got
Promise I won't cry over spilled milk (Ooh, no, I won't)

Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Commas, commas in my head, man
Like they OT

No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
I need you more than I want to
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)
