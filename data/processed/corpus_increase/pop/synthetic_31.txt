And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Tryna compromise, but I canâ€™t win
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
You wanna make a point, but you keep preachin'
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no

And there we are again when nobody had to know
I still remember the first fall of snow
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
I remember it all too well

The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
The only time I'd ever call you mine
