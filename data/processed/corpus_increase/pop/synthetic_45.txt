I got everything I wanted
But I don't wanna let anybody know
I got everything I wanted
Toâ€…anyone who might care

The music's got me going
Then you say
I wanna dance
I wanna dance

But I've read this one where you come undone
You left your typewriter at my apartment
But you awaken with dread
Who's gonna hold you?

One's already on his second wife
One friend left to sell clothes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
