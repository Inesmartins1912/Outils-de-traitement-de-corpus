I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em (Baby, you know I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
And no one here's to blame
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

(Go back to you, go back to you)
I know I said I wasn't sure
I know it's forward, but it's true
But when it heals, it beats for you

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
What are you doin', huh? (Yeah, you just want attention)
What are you doin' to me? (I knew from the start)
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin', love?)
