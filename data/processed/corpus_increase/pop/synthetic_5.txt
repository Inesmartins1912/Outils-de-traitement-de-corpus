Paint my nails cherry-red
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Match the roses that you left
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Watermelon sugar high (Sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
I want your belly and that summer feelin'

I'll stop time for you
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
Let's set this party off right
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket (Keep up)
