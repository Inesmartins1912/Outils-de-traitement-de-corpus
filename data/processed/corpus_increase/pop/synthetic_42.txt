Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight, I'm alive, ain't no dollar sign
You can't tame me, can't tame me
If you don't like the way I talk

Once in twenty lifetimes, I
Vintage tee, brand new phone
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
You put me on and said I was your favorite

You've been actin' so shady (Shady)
I try (I try), and I try (I try), but you'll never see that
Ooh-ooh, you gotta go tell me now
I'll admit (I'll admit), it's my fault (My fault)

You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone
