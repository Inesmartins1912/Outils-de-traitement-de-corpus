You're singin' it together
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

I got everything I wanted
But I don't wanna let anybody know
I got everything I wanted
To anyone who might care

I wanna let her take control
I know we'd be all right, we would be all right
I know we'd be all right, I know we would be all right
I think about her and she knows it

We don't have it anymore
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
