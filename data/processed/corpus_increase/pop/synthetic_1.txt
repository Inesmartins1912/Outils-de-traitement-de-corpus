Oh, na-na-na (No, no, no, take me back)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Hey)
She waited on me (And what?)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Why you sad? I don't know, 난 몰라
널 위해 예쁜 거짓을 빚어내
Now I don't know me, who are you?
아니긴 뭐가 아냐, 난 눈 멀었어
