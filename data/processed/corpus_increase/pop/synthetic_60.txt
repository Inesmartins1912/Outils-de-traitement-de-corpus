You can hit while they watch, boy
'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said
Boy, you're the one, you're the only man
They all wanna know how you get to me

(Now I can't get you outta my brain)
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
(I overdosed, should've known your love was a game)
If he's holdin' onto you so tight

She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

Does it ever?
Just take her home and you'll feel better
I need somebody now (Ooh-ooh)
I'm crawlin' in my skin
