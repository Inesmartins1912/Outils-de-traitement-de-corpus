She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
Needless to say, I'm keeping a check
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck

To carry love, to carry children of our own
I know we'll be alright this time
I will not give you up this time
Not knowin' what it was

I got everything I wanted
But I don't wanna let anybody know
I got everything I wanted
Toâ€…anyone who might care

Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
