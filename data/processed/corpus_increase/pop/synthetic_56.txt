Honey (Ah-ah-ah)
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do (Ah-ah-ah)

Good days, good days, always
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
Feelin' like Jericho

And I won't ever let you go
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Lovin' can hurt
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed

You know you're not alone
I'll be there to save the day
I just wanna set you free
And when you feel like hope is gone
