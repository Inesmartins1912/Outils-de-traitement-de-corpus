I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em (Baby, you know I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
Don't you ever say I just walked away
We jumped, never asking why

Sorry I'm so clingy, I don't mean to be a lot
Warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me (Me, me, me, me, me)
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh, is it warm enough
