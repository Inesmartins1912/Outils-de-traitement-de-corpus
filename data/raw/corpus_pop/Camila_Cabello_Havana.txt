Hey

Havana, ooh, na-na (Hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Hey, hey)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Hey)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (Uh-huh)
Havana, ooh, na-na (Uh)

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (Uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (Uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (Hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (Uh)

He got me feelin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh" (Ayy)
I knew it when I met him (Ayy), I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh"
And then I had to tell him, I had to go
Oh, na-na-na-na-na (Woo)

Havana, ooh, na-na (Hey, hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Hey, hey, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
My heart is in Havana (Hey)
Havana, ooh, na-na
(Jeffery) Just graduated, fresh on campus, hm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn
Fresh out East Atlanta
(Bump, bump) Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (Here you go, ayy)
Back it on me (Back it up)
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (On me)
She waited on me (And what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (Wait up)
This is history in the makin', homie (Homie)
Point blank, close range, that B (Tah, tah)
If it cost a million, that's me (That's me)
I was gettin' mula, baby

Havana, ooh, na-na (Hey, hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh, na-na (Hey, hey; oh, oh)
He took me back to East Atlanta (Uh-huh), na-na-na (Oh no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
My heart is in Havana (Ayy)
Havana, ooh, na-na

Ooh, na-na, oh, na-na-na
Take me back, back, back, like (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, na-na, oh, na-na-na
Take me back, back, back like (Yeah, babe)
Ooh, na-na, oh, na-na-na

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh, na-na (Oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (Hey, hey)
