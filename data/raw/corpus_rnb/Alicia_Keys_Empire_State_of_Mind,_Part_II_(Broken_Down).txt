Ooh, New York
Ooh, New York

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems (Come on)
I got a pocketful of dreams (Come on)

Baby, I'm from New York (Oh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh, come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Oh, come on)
Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)
Hear it for New York (Uh), New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

I'ma make it by any means (Come on)
I got a pocketful of dreams (Come on)

Baby, I'm from New York (Oh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh, come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Oh, come on)
Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)
Hear it for New York (Uh), New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

One hand in the air for the big city (Uh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Yeah)
No place in the world that can compare (Uh)
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

In New York (Oh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of (Oh, come on)
There's nothin' you can't do (Come on)
Now you're in New York (Oh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (Oh, come on)
Big lights will inspire you (Big shine)
Hear it for New York
