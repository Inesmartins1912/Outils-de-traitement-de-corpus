I see you, body full of hate
Crying out for someone to save the day
I tell you God makes no mistakes
Your time will come, have faith
You watchin' others so hard
So much so you forgot to pray to the Lord
You're so phased by the outside world
Don't forget, your peace lives within

Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget

But you're on your own
What you thought was right was mostly wrong
But you waste time thinking about the past
Soon you'll be free at last
Forgive those who focus on your dark parts
Let go of others who broke your heart
Set free friends who decided to part
What's meant to be will be

Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget

Spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
Spirit's much stronger, don't you forget

Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
Butterfly, lost in the night
Running out of faith but your wings are still bright
Hold on, don't you cave in yet
Your spirit's much strong, don't you forget

Spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
Spirit's much stronger, don't you forget
