It's somethin' about me that makes me wonder
I swear I met you, but you're a stranger

Maybe it was me who brought you here

I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story ends, oh

Oh, you remind me of someone I once knew
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's hard to ignore you
And I can't wrap my head around it
But it feels, oh like I loved you before

I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story ends, oh

Say
You know that I'll be that fool for you, yeah

And I'll be a fool for you
I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story ends, oh

Oh, bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, I, I, I
Oh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
