Yeah, hmm-mm

You're spinnin' 'round, and 'round, and 'round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it, I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

I know you gon' be mad, feelings that you thought you had
Was for another guy, well, I'm that other guy
I'm just a shy kid, camouflaged before your eyes
And I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side
I should have told you, but I never had the courage
And I thought you really wouldn’t understand (No)
And now, I'm up here just to let my feelings surface
Apologizin' for disguisin' who I am (Mm)
Tell me, are you who I thought you were?
Or who I wanted you to be?
Did you do it all for him?
Or were you only playin' me?
I did it for you, but I couldn’t see it through

You're spinnin' 'round, and 'round, and 'round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it, I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

You're all I ever wanted
But I got caught in the shadow in the background
But I'm back now
And Kris was all this and that
And my look didn't really fit the rap, it didn't match
He had the style and I had the swag
So I locked up my feelings in the words he said
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask
If you give me a chance, that's all I ask
What you expectin' me to do?
First, you were him and now you're you
Now, it's just me, and you got me on my knees

You're spinnin' 'round, and 'round, and 'round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said, said?
This is it, I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?

Why do I feel so deceived?
Guess I believed what I wanted to believe
It's perfect in my dreams
But nothing's really what it seems
No, no

You're spinnin' 'round, and 'round, and 'round in my head, head
Did you really mean the words that you said (Did you really mean what you said?), said?
This is it, I gotta know
Should I stay or should I go? Show me the truth
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you?
Is it gonna be me and you? (Gonna be me and you)

Mm-mm, yeah-yeah, gonna be me and you, and you
