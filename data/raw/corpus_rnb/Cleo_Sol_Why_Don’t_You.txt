26 ContributorsWhy Donâ€™t You Lyrics
Why don't you just let go
And quiet down your ego
Don't complain about finance
I know your daddy weren't a real man
Go ahead and live your dreams
To me you're stronger than a whole team
I know you can't relax
And you don't want me to know that
I see you work real hard
You wanna help your friends
But trust me baby
You don't owe them
Don't take on peoples problems
I wanna see you smile
Even when you think I'm angry
It's true it might take a while
But it's between you and me

Where's some?
Where's some?
No no, no no

I know you check my texts
Don't you worry 'bout my ex
I might be on his mind
But I never reply
Remember on the weekend
I said I'd make some changes
And you said you'd do the same thing
And I don't wanna fight my king
I had you when you was weak
You caught me on my knees
Don't pressure me for some kids
And I won't pressure you for marriage
I know it's never the right time
But we gotta do things on our time

Sometimes I still doubt myself
But at least now I love myself
And I am quite emotional
That's why you can't get close at all
So I start to push away
The ones that love me cause I'm scared that they might walk away
I'm not perfect
So I try everyday and I grow a little bit
Read a little more so I can educate my kids
Reap for my soul and cleanse my spirit
Pray cause I'm ready for the bloom of the sea
Peace and serenity is all that I need

Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us
Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us
Sometimes we fall in love
Love is always in us
Love, love, ooh

Where's some?
Where's some?
No no, no no

Eat, pray, love, grow
Eat, pray, love, grow
