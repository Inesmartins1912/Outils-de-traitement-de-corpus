Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

It's been a long road but we're finally here (Yeah, yeah)
And the view from the top so beautifully clear
We can see for forever not a cloud in the sky (Hey)
Picture perfect weather everyday of our lives (Everyday of our lives)
Just imagine if everything you wanted came true (Yeah)
Well it happened to me so it can happen to you
We're on a journey of truth and belief is the key (Oh)
So open up your heart and let your light free

Oh, and I feel like I'm glowin'
And I like where I'm goin'
Tonight, I'm showin' up to shine

This little light of mine (Okay, okay, okay, hey)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright, yeah, yeah)
This little light of mine (Okay, okay, okay)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine, alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (Okay, alright, okay)
I'm gonna let it shine (Yeah)
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Front to back, we're packin', stompin', clappin'
Laughin', singin', dancin', passion everlastin'
When I'm rappin' to the track and asking everyone to put yo' hands up, stand up (Put your hands up)
Roxanne, come take my hand and make the congregation rock (Stand up)
We celebratin' and it feels so good (Yeah)
If I could thank everybody here I would (Come on)
I feel like I'm finally free and I
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to fly

Oh, and I feel like I'm glowin'
And I like where I'm goin'
Tonight, I'm showin' up to shine

This little light of mine (Okay, okay, okay)
I'm gonna let it shine (Alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (Okay, okay, okay)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine, alright, alright, alright)
This little light of mine (Okay, alright, okay, this little light of mine)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine (I'm gonna, I wanna let it shine, yeah)

You know it wants to come out (Hey)
Don't hide your shine, y'all (Come on)
Now put yo' hands in the sky
'Cause your light is your love (Here we go)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Come on and sing), oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Here we go, alright, alright, alright)

This little light of mine (This little light of mine)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine)
This little light of mine (Yeah)
I'm gonna let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine)
This little light of mine (This little light of mine)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine), let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine (I'm gonna let it shine), shine, shine
