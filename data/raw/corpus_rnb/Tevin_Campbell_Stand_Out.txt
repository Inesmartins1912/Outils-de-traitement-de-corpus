10 ContributorsStand Out Lyrics
Open up your eyes, take a look at me
Get the picture fixed in your memory
I'm driven by the rhythm like the beat of a heart
And I won't stop until I start to stand out, mm
To stand out, mm

Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waiting in the wings
It ain't a question of "if"
Just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line

Once you're watching every move that I make
You gotta believe that I got what it takes

To stand out above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out 'til ya notice me

If the squeaky wheel's always gettin' the grease
I'm totally devoted to disturbin' the peace
And I'll do it all again when I get done
Until I become your number one

No methods to the madness
And no means of escape
Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape
It ain't a question of "how"
Just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin' to send

I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head
And you know I'm going all of the way to the end

To stand out above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out, 'til ya notice me

If I could make you stop
And take a look at me
Instead of just (Walkin' by)
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice (I'm alive)

All I need is half a chance
A second thought, a second glance
To prove, I got whatever it takes
It's a piece of cake, heh

To stand out above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out, stand out, ay

Stand out!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Stand out!
(Mmm)
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out
'Til ya notice me
