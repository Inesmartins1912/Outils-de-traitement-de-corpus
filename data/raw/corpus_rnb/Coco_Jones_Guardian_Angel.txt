Mm, hey, yeah-yeah-yeah, oh
Yeah, hey

They say I'm young but my purpose is the inspiration of a nation innovation
'Til I change the talk into a conversation
I'm like a doctor and my patients are anxiously waitin'
Healin' all the hatin', that fakin' in the paper chasin'
It's hard to live up to these expectations that I'm facin'
And gain the admiration of an older generation
That's why I'm pacin' back and forth
Contemplatin', meditatin'
How to use what I've been taught as a positive force

Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
I wish you'd understand (I feel free, y'all)
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
No (No), no matter what I do (They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you (But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be my guardian angel

Mm, hey, yeah

I wanna be the greatest in the world
Not for the money, or the fame, or the girls (Nah)
Not for the car keys, or the jet skis, or the vacation to the West Indies
But simply 'cause I love it
When I write, I'm like a puppeteer
Pullin' my strings 'til the melody sings
And the honesty makes me spread my wings
You callin' me out was out your mind
Send that thought back down your spine
I'm on the ground, it's all on the line
Road signs say both ways at the same time
Most days I can't wait to rhyme
Express my stress, elevate and shine
Progress, regress, each step's climbed
So I take that test and I testify

Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
I wish you'd understand (I feel free, y'all)
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
No (No), no matter what I do (They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you (But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be my guardian angel

I feel so misunderstood
'Cause my intentions were good
If you could only see that poetry can hide in the hood
The passion in philosophy of possibilities
Every dream is in my reach
I'll find my freedom in this beat (Hey)
Follow me now, it's a whole new ground
Swallow your pride, I'll make you proud
All of my life I've lived out loud
We just preached to different crowds

Oh, this is who I am
I wish you'd understand
It's time to set me free
My guardian angel
Oh (Oh), this is who I am (It's all me, y'all)
I wish you'd understand (I feel free, y'all)
It's time to set me free (Oh, it's time to set me free)
My guardian angel
No (No), no matter what I do (They try and stop me)
I'm still a part of you (But they can't stop me)
I hope you'll always be my guardian angel
