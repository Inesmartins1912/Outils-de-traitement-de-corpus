16 ContributorsWhen I’m in Your Arms Lyrics
Old wounds, old fights
Another day goes by
I'm not playing by their rules
They can't take me for no fool

Are you gonna rock with me?
Hold me down?
Will you listen? Ever lie to me?
This is all the sign I need

So tell me
Will you keep me safe
When I'm in your arms?
I'm in your arms

Control me
'Cause it feels so good
When I'm in your arms

I don't want you going nowhere
'Cause on the corners of your mind
Helps my body to unwind
Don't waste time

You said you love the way I notice
How you look into my eyes
Right before we cross the line
The way we grind ( ha-ha, ha-ha)
(Break it down, break it down)
(break it down, break it - )

Keep me safe in your arms
Safe in your arms
There's a warmth in your kiss
Don't let go from my grip
(Feels so good in) Your arms

You wanna know how hold on the low
You wanna stay, wanna flow, wanna own
You give me love, then you make things roll
Make me feel something new, something old
You wanna know how hold on the low
You wanna stay, wanna flow, wanna own
You give me love, then you make things roll
Make me feel something new, something old

You wanna know how hold on the low
You wanna stay, wanna flow, wanna own
You give me love, then you make things roll
Make me feel something new, something old
You wanna know how hold on the low
You wanna stay, wanna flow, wanna own
You give me love, then you make things roll
Make me feel something new, something old
You wanna know how hold on the low
You wanna stay, wanna flow, wanna own
You give me love, then you make things roll
Make me feel something new, something old
