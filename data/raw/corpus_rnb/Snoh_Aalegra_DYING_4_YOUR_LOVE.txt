Ooh-ooh, ah
Oh woah
Hm-mm

Tell me, how
Are we supposed to still be talkin' every day
When everything between us just completely changed?
Oh, why?
Tell me, how
Am I supposed to go ahead and just erase
Every feeling, every memory we share?
Oh, why?

'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one

So tell me, how
How could you tell me that you love me by mistake?
Intoxicated, via texts, ain't you ashamed?
That's so wild
So how can I
Believe or trust in anything that you say
When you so easily regret it next day?
See, that ain't right

'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woah

I know nobody's perfect
And we are the way we are
But you know I don't deserve this
And I've waited way too long
'Cause I've been dying for this love, this love
Yeah, I've been dying for your love, your love
