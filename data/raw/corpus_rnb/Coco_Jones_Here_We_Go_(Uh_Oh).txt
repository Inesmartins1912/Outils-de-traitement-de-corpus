Ooh

How come when I see your name on my lock screen
I already know what it means, uh?
I was rollin' in his bed, you was rent free in my head
I thought I was done with that lease
Please
I wanna love another person
Can I please love another person? This time
Oh, oh, me
I been putting all this work in
And you still got a place in my mind
Oh, oh

Why it's gotta be your way? I want it to be mine
What you think this is, foreplay? Must be outta your mind
They tell me to ignore it
Don't you think that I've tried, and I've tried, and I've tried, and I've tried?

I know when you said, "Goodbyе," you ain't mean no goodbye
Herе we go, uh-oh, ah
I know when you get to likin' my pictures it's time
Here we go, uh-oh, ah
Over and over, and over we go
Older and older, and older, but so?
Soon as I finally meet someone else that I like
Here we go, uh-oh, ah

Already know (Know)
Could never be a bitter person 'cause I'm grown (Grown)
You always outside, take your ass back home
Pullin' up on me, boy, you wrong
Uh-uh-oh

Why it's gotta be your way? I want it to be mine
What you think this is, foreplay? Must be outta your mind
They tell me to ignore it
Don't you think that I've tried, and I've tried, and I've tried, and I've tried?

I know when you said, "Goodbye," you ain't mean no goodbye
Here we go, uh-oh, ah
I know when you get to likin' my pictures it's time
Here we go, uh-oh, ah
Over and over, and over we go
Older and older, and older, but so?
Soon as I finally meet someone else that I like
Here we go, uh-oh, ah

Better man, why don't you just be the better man?
Why I gotta be the bigger man?
You just wanna be the middle man
Tryna get in between
Why don't you just be the better man?
Why I gotta be the bigger man?
You just wanna be the middle man
Tryna get in between
Better man, why don't you just be the better man? (Baby, did you cry around?)
Why I gotta be the bigger man?
You just wanna be the middle man (Oh-ooh)
Tryna get in between
Why don't you just be the better man? (I see you playing games)
Why I gotta be the bigger man?
You just wanna be the middle man (Oh-oh, oh)
Tryna get in between
