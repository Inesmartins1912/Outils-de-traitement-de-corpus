We got London on da Track

I been all in my phone, I got options
And I don't wanna tell you to drop it
But I don't wanna play unfair, yeah, yeah
Somethin' that makes me look at you too often
And, baby, you can give it somethin'
Maybe I can ride overtime, oh

Baby, I'm talkin' crazy
I need you right in my space
But I need it, baby, I'm late
But I still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend
But I wouldn't wanna leave you, no
I wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind, and my body is sayin' (Say it, say it)
My mind, my mind, and my body is
My body is sayin' (Say it, say it)
My mind, my mind, and my heart
My body is sayin'

I don't know what it is
I can't tell you what it is
But you got me goin' crazy
Sex with you is so amazin'
How, how long can you go, baby?
Better last 'til my body's sore 'cause it's crazy (Crazy)

Baby, I'm talkin' crazy
I need you right in my space
But I need it, baby, I'm late
But I still can check in with you
I know that I need my friend
But I wouldn't wanna leave you, no
I wouldn't wanna plead
But my heart, my mind, and my body is sayin' (Say it, say it)
My mind, my mind, and my body is
My body is sayin' (Say it, say it)
My mind, my mind, and my heart
My body is sayin'

I know, oh, I
I know, oh, alright
I know we ain't gotta talk, alright
I know you ain't gotta talk, alright
Baby, I, I just wanna talk to you
I just wanna talk to you
Done with that shit, done with that shit
Know what I would give, I
