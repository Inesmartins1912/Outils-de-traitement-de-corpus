Memories fading, I try to hold on
When I don't know where I belong no more
The sound of your voice was my all, was my home
But these walls, they can't hear you no more, no more

Searching high and low for peace of mind
I feel I lost a piece of mine
And I wish that time never mattered

'Cause silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
'Cause silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

Now that the spring comes, I try to stay strong
But every part of me aches, all alone, all alone
The goldfields of sunflowers, all in their bloom
Now I close my eyes to feel you, oh you

Searching high and low for peace of mind
I feel I lost a piece of mine
And I wish that time never mattered

'Cause silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
'Cause silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh I, wish time never mattered

If I only knew
I'd never take for granted
The times I took for granted, oh
If I only knew
I'd cherish it forever
'Cause you're what always mattered to me

Silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
I wish time never mattered
'Cause silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart, yeah-yeah
Oh I, wish time never mattered

I wish that time
I wish that time
That time never mattered
